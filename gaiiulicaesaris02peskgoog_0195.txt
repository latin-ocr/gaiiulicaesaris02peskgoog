166 DE BELLO CIVILI.

hardly be sense and is not supported by the two passages quoted in
defence of it, B. G. 11. ¹⁷ fi a and rv. ης 1: the best correction
that I have seen is effectis adopted by F. Hoffmann and Dinter.

· KH think that the word legionibus took the place of impedinuntis ⁴

which was then transferred to follow praestilit, and so read relictis
impedimentis subsequitur, praeterlapsae etc.
01 3canvertunt nss; Madvig conserant, Pauly conectunt. No change is
needed.
renudia dabam Μῦες Madvig nnnecessarily metiebantur.
5 supplices male haberi MSS, but b and perhaps a have suppliciis,
which is no doubt right and is accepted by recent editors.
6 ad id expeditiores uss ; id is meaninglecs; 1 accept iter suggested by
Manutius and adopted by Paul.
02 r Caesaris usS, Paul Caesari, which iS very likely right.
reiquae munitrbm's fiebat causa (or causa fiebat) nss; Forch·
hammer restored reliquae: when this had been corrupted to rei quae,
fiebat was added to make some sense. Nipperdey with less pro·
bability bracketed the words qaae muuitiosu'sfiebat.
a proelr'a diffugisse mss; praelium deflagisseis required.
3 er'sdem de causis MSS ς it seems necessary to eject de with Paul.

spatii brevitas...ad summam vitoriae nss; Madvig spatii brevitate ⁴

...ad summam pretoria, so too Meusel. I prefer to retain the text.
4hinc rass3 though hinc is not elsewhere used by Caesar in this
partitive sense, I prefer retaining it to reading harum with Paul.
88 1 tertia MSS; the corruption is dne to the preceding aa'es.
3The uass omit ne, and hl insert non before comnritteretr ltis more
likely that ne was absorbed by nasi than that it was omitted or
corrupted into non before committeret. I therefore follow Nipperdey
and other recent editors rather than Paul.
tamea Mss3 the editors alter this to tuan the two words are
often confused in MSS, yet I cannot see the need for change here.
The idea is ‘though each seemed to attain his object, yet the affair
drags on and in reality neither side gains any advantage ’.
04 4 feminas MSS, a strange blunder forferas.
5 necesse habeant Oa f, necesse habeat hl, rightly Ι think. So Paul
after Madvig.

oe ase omitted in MSS, rightly supplied by Aldus: the omission led to
the false reading noluerint for nalum't.

5 haematiten MSS ; humilitate restored by Aldus.
6neque tot tantasque classes paratas wss3 the editors generally regard
