sion ο1 these offices conferred nobility a new order of nobles

had misen, who became in time as exclusive as the old patriciana,
and by their numbers and wealth succeeded in concentrating in
their own hands all the powers of government The senate,
which was chiefly composed of the new nobility, had now
virtually absorbed most ol the iunctions os the popular as·

a wider basis. Two os his mensures merit particular attention
as lraught with consequences lor the future. He instituted the
