assumptions on the fact of his being named Cornelius, as 14 years before
another Cornelius Lentulus, on the strength of some real or pretended .
oracla, had claimed to be the third Cornelius who should hold supreme
sway in Rome, the other two having been Cinna aud Sullae Sall. Cat.

cp. Cicero’s expression about Pompey Att IX. 105 6, ito sullaturit eius
anianus et proscrtpturit iamdiu.

but there is probably no particular reason for the change of number.
necessetudine] cp. note on r 5 4. .
a'udica'orum metus] though Plutarch (Pomp. 55) speaks of him as
γένους ἕνεκα καί δόξης ἄμεμπτος, yet he was threatened with a prosecution
for bribery in connection with the consular electione of 52 and was only
saved by the intervention of Pompey his son-in-law: cp. Dion Χῖ.. 51
Κίιντον Σκιπίωνα πενθερόν reci dora καί δεκασμοῦ αίτίαν ἔχοντα προσεί-
λετο...παρ’ αὐτοῦ (Πομπηίαν) τήν τε ὑπατείαν καί τὸ μὴ καπηορηθῆναι
ἀπέλαβε. iude'ciorum metus does not mean ‘fears as to the constitution
of the courts of justice’ (Moberley).
ostentatio sua] therela probably some corruption in the tert as itis
difficult to make potentium a genitive after ostentatio: ‘adutaso’o is the
flattery of Scaevola’s friends, ostmtatio sui the vanity which made him
accessible to it: potentium seems an error for potmte'o comm '. J. s. n.
4 quod mortinem volebat] cp. the well known line of Lucan 1. 125 nec
quemquam iamferre potest Caesarve pn'orem Pompeiusve parem ; Florus
11. 13 and ¹4 nec ille (Pompeius) ferebat parem. nec hie superiorem.
Pompey’s arrogance and misplaced confideuce in himself are constantly
referred to, cp. Plut. Pomp. 57.

scos.
cum communibus inimicus &c.] the sentence is obscure and the
commentators have little or nothing to say about it. Caesar seems to
mean that Pompey had reconciled himself with persons who had
professed a common eumity for himself and Caesar, after causing the
“ burdeu of their eumity to fall chiefly ou the latter during the time that
the two were connected by marriage, ie. lac. 59-54. Caesar is probably
thinking chiefly of Cato and Cicero, as well as of the great body of
respectable persam whom Pompey’s want of tact when at the head of
affairs in Rome had so far alienated that they looked with suspicion
not only on himself but also on Caesar with whom he was associated in
