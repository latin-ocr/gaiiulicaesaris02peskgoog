ianque adesse. With Caesar supply nuntiabatur from the following
plural.

a luae Marcellus] as stated above the consuls left ou the 18th,
Pompey on the 17th‚

3 Apulia] Appian says twice (B. C. Π. 29, 31) that the two legions
wintered in Capua: possibly they were stationed there first and moved
to Apulia later on. Cicero no doubt refers to these legions in Att. vn.
rr 5 a ille iterLare‘num; ibi enim cohortes et Luceriae et Teani relrpuaque
iu Apulea. That they were not all in one town is shown by the word
de'sposrurat ‘had distributed’. Stoffel 1. ²⁰4·

4 citra] ‘on this’ (ie. the Roman) ‘side of Capua'.

omuibus videtur] ‘it is considered by all': nileil tutum esse is acc. and
inf.; beware of taking nileil as subject of ae'detur.

sese collegunt] like our word ‘to rally' the phrase se colligere may be
used in the literal sense ‘to collect together ’, or in the derived ‘to collect
oneself’ (like our slang phrase ‘to pull oneself together’); here it isused
rather in the latter sense. The subject of the verbs is to be drawn from
the context—Pompey and the consuls etc.

hic quid agatur, tota Capua et oeeenis lie delectus iacet.

gladiatores] Caesar kept a training school (Iulus) for gladiators at
Capua. Pompey wished to enlist them in his army, but public feeling
was so strong against the employment of such men in warfare that he
relinquished the plan. As it was feared that they might rise he dis·
tributed them for custody among the householders of Capua r Cic. Att.
