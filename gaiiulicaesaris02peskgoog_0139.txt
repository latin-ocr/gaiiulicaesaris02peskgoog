rro DE BELLO CI VILI. [ura. r.

Caesar had left or retained 9⁰0 to serve as his own bodyguard3 the
rest had been sent forward under Fabius.

iu castra pervenit] four old Roman calendars give a Aug. as the date
of the capitulation of Afranius and Petreius. Curio in his speech 11. 32
5 5 states that Caesar effected the conquest in 40 days from his first
appearance before the Pompeian camp, which would thus fall a 3 June.
From §a we learn that he took up his position before the hill of
Gardeny, where the Pompeians were encamped, the day after his
arrival at the camp of Fabius. He therefore reached the latter aa June.
The journey from Massilia to Ilerda, a distance of about 394 miles, might
take 18 days (Stollel), which would make the date of his leaving Massilia
about 5 June. These dates must of course nothe regarded as anything
more than approximate, for we cannot be sure that Curio's 40 days is to
be interpreted strictly.

tempestate] this word, which originally meant a period of time, then
weather good οτ bad, came to mean usually bad or ‘tempestuous’
weather3 so too valetudo which was originally any state of health came
to mean bad health, whence our ‘valetudinarian ’.

a sex cohortes] probably one from each of his six legions.

tmplicr' instructa acte] the army consisting of 54 (oo-6) cohorts was
drawn up before starting in three linesr by a quater-tum to the right they
were formed into three columns, and so marched to their destination.
When the heads of the columns reached the right of the hill of Gardeny
a quatiet-turn to the left would bring thern back into three lines ready
for action (Stoilel).

sub arrm's] this and iu armis are used indifferently; cp. below §4
acies in armis...permanebat.

r'u media colle] ‘half way up the hill ⁹.

3 stare] ‘that it was only owing to Afranius that a pitched battle was
not fought’: cp. 11. 13 ἓ 4 graviterque eam rem tulerunt quad stetisse per
Trebonium, qua miuus appatio potirentur, videbatur: in this usage stare
takes quin or quo minus or ne.

intermissu] with ab, ‘at an interval of about 400 paces from ’.

4 quod...crat] ‘which could not fail to be a prominent object and Ι

visible from afar’.
XV] this denotas the width of the fosse at the top, not the depth.
post hos] cp. Lucan 1v. 28 pronatum Caesar Olympo Ι in noctem
subita circumdedit agmina firssa, Ι dum primae perstant (or praestant)
acies, hostemque sesetlr't, Ι et prope consertas abduxit castra maniplis.
5 intellegeretur] ‘it should be understood ἐ see note on aa fi a.
