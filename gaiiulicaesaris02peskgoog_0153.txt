ιη ’ ner Besaro crrrrr. [ns. 1.

quoad] ‘so long as’: cp. B. G. rw. ra quoad potuit sanissime restitit,·
elsewhere in Caesar quoad means ‘until’.

detergere] ‘sweep ols' ; the oars in en ancient man-os·war could not,
be ‘shipped' as readily as in a snmll sowing boat. Florus 1. 18 θ 8
uses detorquere remos apparently in a similar sense.

3 cum...tum] lor cunt...tum ‘not only...but also’ connecting two verbs,
cp. Β. G. v. 4 quad cum merita eius a se fieri intellegebat tum magni
interesse arbitrabatur ,· vn. ²3 cum...est...tum...lralet,· Caes. ap. Cic.
nrt. lx. 652 atque ega eram ex ipsa re magnam capio voluptatem, tum
merem factum probari als te triumpha gaudia: more osten it is used
with two contrasted substantives as in B. G. vr. 30 nrultum cum in
omnihus rebus tum in re militari polest fortuna: sometimes ettam is

’ added to emphasise rherum, cp. 62 ἕ a cum altitudine aquae tumeliam

rapiditate fluminis.

nequedum...cagmitis] ‘inasmuch as they did not yet know even the
names oi the various tackle'. The clause is suspected by some editors
ol being a gloss

usum celeritatis] celeritatis is a defining genitive explaining in what
the usses consists, ‘the same handiness in point ol speed'. But KH take
it rather differently, ‘the usesulness which speed gives’.

4 dum] ‘provided that' ς not elsewhere so used in Caesar.

dr'aersr] ‘on opposite sides'; one ol Caesar’s ships grappled two oi
the Massilian ships, and so the crew oi the former had to sustain a
oonflict in two directions a hostile crew being on each side oi thern.
It was in this battle that a centurion oi the Xth legion named C. Acilius,
having lost his right hand while boarding one oi the enemies’ ships,
seized his sword in his lest hand and fought gallantly on till the crew
surrendered. The story is told by Plutarch Caes 16, Suet. Caes. 68,
Valerius Maximus 111. a. aa.

cum eis, quae sunt captae] ‘including those that are captured ’. The
form oi expression is extremely awkward and the tent is probably
cormpt. From 11. 551 we leam that six ships were captured, hence
Paul ingeniously suggests naves Massiliensium Domitiique sunt captae
VI, intereunt IX. In 57 ἕ 4 the proper name Domitii is conupted in
the uss into indomiti.

CHAP. LIX.

r nuntiatur] the date ol this sea-right may be determined with
sufficient precision. It has been assumed that the tlood at Ilerda

began 28 June, cp. 48 §13 ir lasted several days, 50 9 r hae pmman·
