⁶2 'DE antro crant [nn. 1.

nudata...tamen] nudata potestate is a concessive abl. absolute
‘though he bad stripped’ followed by tamen ; cf. Cic. Att. vn. 18 5 a
Caesarem quidem L. Caesare earm medatis de pace mirso tamea aium
acerrime delectum habere ‘although he had sent '.

4 videatur] ‘is supposed to have restored ’, ‘has the reputation of
having restored ’.

dona...habuerr'nt] the privilege oi inviolability. The text is probably
corrupt.

5 quotienscumque] the decree was passed in the years 121, 100, 83,
63, ⁵²·

qua...vocatus] the general effect of the senatur consultum altimum is
thus summarIzed by Sallust, Cat. 29 ea potestas per senatum mare
Romano magistratui maxima permittitur, aeram parare, bellum
gerere, coercere ornnibur madir socos atque abes, danti militiaeque
imperium atque iudicium summum hobae: aliter sine papuli iussu
nullises earum rerum consulitur est. With Caesar’s expression cp.
Liv. Epit. 61 ex saratas consulta nuato ad arma populu Cic. de orat.
11. 13² cum ex senatus consulto ad arma vocasset.

, inperm'crasis legibus] this would apply to the years 120 and roo when
tadical changes in the law had been proposed by C. Gracchus and
L. Apuleius Saturninus. ' Whether their laws were really perm'eiosaeis
another matter.

e'n vi tribunicia] this would also apply to the same two years. ln
the case of Tib. Gracchus nc. 133 apparently no such decree was
passed. “ The murder of Tib. Gracchus and his 300 followers had not
even a semblance os legality. Plut. Tib. Gracch. 19 distinctly says that
the consul Scaevola refused to allow the SCtum to be passed. Hence
consulem langaeneem in Cic. T. D. 1v. 513 in gerenda re segnior p.
Domo 9¹³ the other accounts in Val. Max. 111. a 17 all l think agree.”
J. s. n.

in secessione papuli...occupatis] as iu rur when the Aventiue was
occupied by an armed multitude, le. Epit. 61. Caesar may also be
thinking of the well-known secessiones pepedi in 342 when M. Valerius
Corvus was appointed dictator, and in 287 when Q. Hortensius was
appointed, ior, though the appointment oi a dictator was not quite
the same thing as the senatus consultum ultimum by which the senate
empowered the higher magistrates to secure the safety oi the state, yet
the practical effect was much the same, i.e. the ordinary laws were

suspended. The dictatorship was not employed aster aar till revived
by Sulla in 8².
