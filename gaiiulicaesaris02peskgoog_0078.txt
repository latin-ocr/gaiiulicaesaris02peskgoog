a close political ally oi Pompey, and his utteranoes were not unnaturally
regarded as prompted by Pompey‚ especially as the latter was in the
neighbourhood of Rome, though as proconsul and armed with the im-
perium he could not enter the city. A lew days before this Pompey bad
travelled with Cicero from Lavernium (i) to Formiae, apparently on his
way to Rome ; Cic. Att. vn. 8 ἓ 4 ; see below ἕ 6 terrore praesentis
exercilus.

a aliquis] ‘some one’: Caesar then proceeds to particularise, mention·
ing Marcellus, Calidius, Rufus. Dr Reid’s suggestion dixerant aliqui
would make the sentence simplet.

primo] ‘at first’r he afterwards changed his opinion, see below
§5-
M. Marcellus] consul 51, see note on 1 ἓ 1.
· engressus] ‘starting with a discourse oi this kind '.
Ἴ de ea re] Caesar's proposals.
p, 2. quo praesidab]=ul eo praesidzb.

3 M. Calidius] one os the praetors of 57, and an unsuccesslul candi-

date in the Caesarian interest for the consulship oi 50.

ereptis] in the previous year adecree of the senate had been passed
that Caesar and Pompey should each furnish a legion sor the Parthian
war. Pompey undertook to provide the legion which he had previously
lent to Caesar. The latter accordingly had to give up this legion as
well as to furnish one of his own, thus losing the nse os two legions, the
first and the fifteenth, while Pompey's forces remained unimpairedz cp.
B. G. v111. 54.

ab eo] one would rather expect a se, and suum, ior eius pen'culum5

, see note on 35 5 4. It is os course just possible that ab eo may mean ‘by

him’ (Pompey) in which case eo and eius will reier to different persons.

m...vr'derctur] ‘lest it should appear that P. was holding them back
and retaining thern near the city with a view to imperil him' (Caesar).
The two legions were stationed either at Capua or in Apulia (cp. ¹4
ἓ 3), hence ad urbem is misleading, though no doubt Pompey had some
troops with him near Rome: cp. Appian 11. 29, Dion xl. 65, ΧΗ. a ἐν
γὰρ rui προαστείῳ rdr δυνάμεις εἶχε.

retinere] cp. B. G. vm. 55 cognoscit...lcgianes duas,..Cn. Pompeio
traditas atque in Italia retentas επις cic. Att. vu. 13». ἓ 2 spes
omnis in duabus iamdiose retentis, paene alienis legionibus ; below 9 ἃ 4.

4 M. Rufus] M. Caelius Rufus, aedile in 50, a strong partisan oi
Caesar. Seventeen of his letters to Cicero written in the years 51—48
have been preserved (Fam. vnn).
