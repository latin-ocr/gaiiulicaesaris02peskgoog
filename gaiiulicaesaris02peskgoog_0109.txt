80 DE BELLO CI VILI. [tut t.

codem sere tempore] this would be on the 19th, Pompey having
received Domitius' letter on the 17th.

Cute, XIX. ’

ι litteris] fortunately this very letter written at Luceria 17 Feb. is
preserved sor us in Cic. Att. v111. ra n. The tenor of it is—‘What 1
expected has happened. Caesar avoids a pitched battle, and has shut
you up to prevent my wavering legions from being strengthened by the
accession of your loyal troops. 1 must not rislr the tortunes ot the state
by engaging Caesar, nor have I all my reiniorcements Get free and join
me is you can'. Previous letters had passed between the two generals.
Pompey wrote 11 Feb„ expressing his surprise that Domitius had
abandoned his original intention os joining him, end urging him to do so
at once: on 16 Feb. he writes again acknowledging two letters from
Domitius, both probably written on the 14th, in the first of which
Domitius had said that he was keeping an eye on Caesar's movements
and would join Pompey as soon as he could, in the second he urges
Pompey to come to him at once, which Pompey says he dare not do
with his untrustworthy forces.

consilio] ‘council ot war': consilium may mean ‘council’ as well as
‘counsel’, but concilium only ‘council'.
parent] supply ut from the preceding ne.
a arcano] a rare word, only here in Caesar.
oratmru] ‘his words', ‘his way' oi talking'.
cremasset] the indicative would be more usual ; the subjunctive
marks a kind oi oratio obliqua, the fact being put as viewed by the men
in the camp.
multumque...fugeret] this clause, connected with the preceding by que,
is itseli divided into two parts multum...colloqueretur and concilia...
sugeret which are not connected by a copula ε translate the latter ‘while
avoiding conucils’ etc.

3 neque suo consr'lio] so Cicero says Art. vm. ra 5 ·6 omnino culpam
omnm Pompeius in Domitium consen.

4 ficisset] ‘should have offered itselt’.

oppila] there is no need to alter the position of this word: ‘by the
blocksde and hythe investment ot the town'.

fiebat] ‘it was being brought abont’ ; not quite the same assactum m.
There is some trace os carelessness in this use office-i and fiebat in the
same sentence.
