150 DE Burro cruror. [nn. 1.

conduct of himself and his army mentioned in 77, when he dismissed
nnharmed all the soldiers of Afranius whom he found in his camp,
though several of his own men had been put to death by that general’s
orders.

de couitmndapace] cp. 26 ἕ 3, Β. G. vu. 55.

3 sic...coustitisse] ‘thus the part played by all ranks had been one of

compassion’ or ‘had consisted in compassion ’.

indutiarum] Caesar goes too far in saying that the enemy's officers
had disregarded the rights of truce 3 for there had been no formal
cessation of hostilities when the intercourse between the two camps
mentioned in 74 took place, nor was the colloquium a formally arranged
conference‚ but only a spontaneous act on the part of individnal soldiers

per colloquium deceptos] ‘taken in by a pretended colloquy'3 per is
ollen thus used ol a false or pretended reason, cp. B. G. V111.a3 qui
eum per simulationem colloquii curaret interficiundum so per causam is
often used of a pretended reason as in B. G. vu. 9, cp. Draeger HS 1.
p. 607.

4 eo] this as well as s'dis the antecedent to the following quod.

5 humilitate] ‘on the ground of their humiliation': ablative of ‘efficient
cause’, Roby§ raa8.

aliqua temporis opponunitatc] ‘any fortunate conjuncture of events ’.
postulare, quibus mous] ‘make demands whereby ’.

6 neque enim] ‘neither was it for any other reason that six legions had
been sent into Spain and a seventh levied there’ ete. Caesar asserts
that this large army was maintained in Spain solely for the pumose of
being used against himself. The force originally designed for Spain
consisted of four legions, Plut Pomp. 523 to this had been added two
legions drawn from Africa (Merivale 11. 175, on what authority l do not
lrnow), and from the present passage (alone i) we learn that the remain-
ing legion had been levied in Spain itself, thus making the total of serem
as given also in 385 1.

tot tantasque classes paratas] this, the reading of the erS, is rejected
by most editors who think the mention of fleets out of place here. No
doubt it is somewlrat out of place in a speech addressed to Afranius and
Petreius and referring to events in Spain, bnt Caesar, writing in haste
and indignation, thinks of all the fleets that had been equipped against
him during the last few months and adds them to his mention of the
Spanish army, forgetting that Afranius and Petreius had but little to

do with them. We have read in this book of the fleet that eonveyed
Pompey from Brundisium (27), the ships raised by Domitius (34 fia),
