magna...rerum] the clause is abrupt and barsh without a verb.
Possibly fit should be inserted before magara, having been absorbed by

1 &uuum hauns] the authorities are agreed that the spot in question
is to be sought at a distance of from ato 4 kilometres above llerda;
cp· 64 5 8 where the circuit by the ford from Caesar’s camp to the river
bank opposite Ilerda is reckoned at 6 miles (ᾖ English miles). The
bed of the river here broadens out, and the stream flows for the most
part in one main and two or more subsidiary channels‚ leaving here and
there stretches of exposed river bed. As to the method however by which
the derivation of the stream was effected, the authorities differ seriously.
G'dler and Stoffel suppose that Caesar's ditches were dug from the main
body of the stream, of equal depth with it, and were carried parallel to
the river for some little distance, and then emptied into it again·¹ These
ditches, being only 30 ft. wide, could easily be crossed by planias, and
the main stream, being thus diminished in volume, would be easily
fordable. But Schneider, following Guischard, arguas that a stream
like the Segre flowing at the rate of a feet a second would not be
appreciably lowered by such derivation of its waters, and that Caesar’s
work must have been of a more elaborate character. lle supposes that
on the right bank, where the level of the adjacent country is below the
river bank, Caesar had a large basin dug about 6 fi. in depth, into
which he diverted a considerable part (panem aliquam) of the river by
