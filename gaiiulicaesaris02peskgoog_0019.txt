perpetually menaced the Roman possessions in Asia. That a
power such as Pompey's‚ not based on any hereditary right, nor
consolidated by time, nor indeed supported by the loyal ad·
herenee of a united people, should be exposed to the plots ol an
ambitious rival was only natural. Such a rival now arose in
the person ol Caesar, the greatest ol the Romans.

ἓ 10. Gaius Iulius Cacsar.

Born probably in 102, of a noble family, connected by birth
with Marius and by marriage with Cinna, Gaius Julius Caesar
had passed an adventurous youth and had won the hearts os
the Roman people by his boundless liberality, his fascinating
address and his reckless audacity But these showy qualities
concealed a resolute patience and fixity of purpose that knew
how to bide its time. The long absence of Pompey in the East

srom 67 to 62 gave him scope for increasinghis popularity and Ι

maturing his plans. He became aedile in 65, and in 63 he was
elected Pontifex Maximus.

ἕ 11. T lta compz'racy of Catilius.

’ ln the same year, 63, the conspiracy of Catiline broke out,
only to be promptly suppressed by the energy of the consul
Cicero. This conspiracy “was not the work of the popular
party, and still less was it an unselfish attempt at reform¹;'’ it
was rather the attempt ol a desperate adventurer to retrieve his
position by inciting the disaffected mob to a general rising.
How sar Caesar was implicated in it cannot now be known, but it
is probable that he saw in the widespread popular discontent an
opening lor his own ambitious schemes, and that he was ready,
if the conspiracy should gain ground, to shape the issue to suit
his own ends. At the trial he pleaded sor the life of the
prisoners but his intervention was in vain, Some ol the
leading conspirators were executed‚ the rest including Catiline
himself shortly after lell in battle, and tranquillity was sor a time
restored to Italy.
