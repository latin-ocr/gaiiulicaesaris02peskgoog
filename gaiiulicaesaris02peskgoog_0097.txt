if he should stay in Italy till Caesar’s consulship was over, that is, till
the beginning oi 47. But the text is probably faulty, and there islittle
point in the reference to the end of Caesar's office. Ι should like to read
si peractis consularibus tantillis non profectus esset. Caesar would theu
refer to the possibility of Pompey's remaining in Italy at the head
of au army till alter the consular electioris and so intluencing their
result.

4 itaque...occupat] Nissen remarks that iu this paragraph Caesar
distorts the sequence of events in an incredible way. The news of the
capture of these towns reached Rome before Cicero left the city, which

he didon the 18th, cp. Att. 1x. 10 ἓ 4, Fam. xvi. 1²5²· Yet Caesar ᾗ

here says that he did not occupy thern till alter he had received Pompey's

reply, which could not have reached him before the 29thl The course κ
of events was somewhat as follows. The tribunes were expelled from
the senate ou 7 Jau.; news of this reached Caesar at Ravenna on the ,

Here he harangued his troops, dwelling ou the insuit done to the sacred
tribunicial office. Without delay he pushed forward detachments of
troops to occupy Arretium and the coast towns Meanwhile Pompey
not having yet heard of the crossing of the Rubicon sent L. Caesar and
Roscius with proposals to Caesar, whom they found at Ariminum on or

with whom they had an interview at Teanum on the a3rd. After a τ

further deliberation'at Capua ou the a5th the envoys returned to Caesar
at Ariminum, arriving there about the aoth. The news of Caesar’s
crossing of the Rubicon and capture of the Italian towns, brought
presumably by successive messeugers, reached Rome, as stated above,
before the rath, probably ou the 15th, r6th, aud 17th, and cousequently

M. Stoffel’s careful investigations into the perplexing chrpnology of this
period.
