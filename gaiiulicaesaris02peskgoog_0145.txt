officers called centuriones, one called prior and the other possem
There were thus 60 centurions in a legion, and the lowest in rank was
the posterior ol the roth maniple of the hastati, the decim hastatus
posterior, while the highest was the prior ol the first maniple ol the
triam'i, or, as he was usually called lor brevity, the primipilus (pilus
meaning triarius). After Marius the legion was divided into ro cohorts,
each cohort containing 3 maniples, and, as before, each maniple had
its prior and its posterior centura'o. In order to distinguish the different
centurions the old names were retained, and the 6 centurions oi any
cohort, say the first, would be thus designated :—

prim and posterior ltostatm
prior and posterior princeps primae cohortis.

prior and posterior pilus

The lowest in rank ol the 6ο centurions was the posterior hastatus ol the κ

roth cohort, and the highest was the prior pilosos the first cohort, or,
as he was usually called, the primipilus. Apparently a man rose by
mccoeuve steps from the lowest to the highest place; thus he might

begin by being posterior leostalus of the roth cohort, then posterior l

leostatus oi the 9th, and so on to the rst cohort, aiter which he would
be posterior princeps ol the ro cohorts in order, beginning with the roth,
then posterior triarius in the same order, aller this he would go through

the ro cohorts first as prior hastatus, then as prior primoris, then as 1

prior triarius, reaching the highest point as prior triarius (or primi·
pilus) ol the first cohart. Another well supported view is that a man
did not go from one eohort to another as here described, but passed

through allthe posts in one cohort at a timer thus he would be (ι) ¹

posterior hastatus, (a) prior hastatus, (3) posterior princeps, (4) prim

princeps, (5) posterior triarius, (6) prim triarius in the roth cohart, and ,

so on through the remaining cohorts, till, as belore, he reached the
highest post os prior triarius or primipilus ol the first cohort. It
should be remarked that each cohort was commanded by its senior

centurion, that is, by its prior triarius (primipilus). Iu the present ¹

passage lrastoto appears to be used for manipulo hastatorum, and the

meaning is that Fulginius ‘belonged to' (ex) the first maniple of the ,

leostoti that is, he was the prr'or hastatus of the first cohort3 on
theother hand Τ. CaeciliuS, mentioned directly alter, was the proisi
pili centurio (=primipilus), that is, the highest ol all the centurions
oi the XIVth legion. The chief authorities on this difficult subjectare
given by Dr H. Schiller in his Kriegsaltertiimer in Mtiller’s Handbuch.
