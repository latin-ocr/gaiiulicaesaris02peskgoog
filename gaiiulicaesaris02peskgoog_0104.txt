caen. xv. xva] NOTES. 75

(quas potest contrabit). It is possible that there may be some corruption
in the MSS, aud if there is not, the discrepancy need not surprise us
much, considering the difficulty of communication in those days and the
absence of official documents.

6 Domitium Ahenobarbum] cp. note on 6 55. According to Appian Ι

11. 32, 38 he brought with him to Corfinium in Jauuary a force of 4000
men which he had apparently raised with a view to his governorship of
Gaul, to which he had been appointed as Caesar's successor. This force
was divided into 12 cohorts, see note on 17 ἓ a.

Corfinium] this important stronghold was situated in the country ol
the Paeligni on the site of the modern town of Pentima, in a plain about
rroo sect above the sea-level, surrounded by lofty mountains. It was on
the via Valeria, and the river Aternus (Aterno or Pescara) flowed to the
north of it. A sew miles south was Sulmo (Selmena), the birthplace of

‘ Ovid.

abiegnis itineribus] ‘forced marches'. Vegetius, de re militari, seems
to reckon ay'miles a good day’s march. The distance from Asculum
to Corfinium is 165 kilometres which, assuming that the march occupied
four days (Stoffel 1. ano), would give about ²5l miles a day. They
probably reached Corfinium 8 Feb.

Alba] now Albe, a town of the Marsi, about ao miles westward os
Corfinium. The abl. (unless we, read the locative Albae) must be
taken with coegerat ‘had collected (and brought) from Alba ’ς then the
words ex Marsis et Paelignis state of what tribes the troops consisted;
to this is further added finitimis ab regebnibus erpressing the neigh-
bourhood from which they were drawn, ‘from the neighbouriug parts ’.
The sentence is rather awkwardly worded, but it does not improve it
to alter ex to et as KH and Doberenz do.

Crine. XVI.

1 recepto Firmo] cp. Cic. Att. vm. η Β §1 (Pompey to Domitius)
rram illa causo, quam mibi Vibullius· scribit, levis est, te propterea ma·
‘ratum esse, quod audieris Caesarem Firmo progressum in Castrum
Truentinum venisse. Taking these two passages together Ido not see
how one can doubt that Caesar did, whether in person or not, occupy
F irmum and Truentum on his way to Asculum. KH object to reading
Firmo here sor three reasons, but (i) the alleged divergence between
this statement and the general tenor os 15 ἐξ 1, a (see my note) must
not be pressed too much considering the undoubted instances oi haste
