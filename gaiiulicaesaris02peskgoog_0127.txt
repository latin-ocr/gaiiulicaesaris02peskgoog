Taranto, and Sipontum was near the site oi the medem Maufredonia.
Troops were also stationed at Hydruntum torrento), App. Β. C. 11. 40.

proiciatur] Caesar seems to have left Brundisium 18 March ς he
stopped at Beneventum a5th, Capua etth, Sinuessa emh, and had an
interview with Cicero at Formiae on the 28th3 cp. Cic. Art. lx 15 5 6,
1651, 18, 1951. Plutarch Pomp. 62 makes Caesar visit Rome before
the investment of Brundisium, but in Caes. 35 he puts the events in
their right order.

a coacto senatu] in the absence ol the consuls. the tribunes M. Antonius
and Q. Cassius Longinus convoked the senate for 1 April outside the
pomerium, probably in the temple of Apollo outside the porta Carmen·
eata.

iniurias] so in his speech to his troops at Ravenna (7 5 r) omnium
temporum iniurias inimicumne commemorat.

extraordinarium honorem] ‘extra-ordinary officet i-e. out oi the
common order. This is a hit at Pompey who had held many offices
extra ordinem. Note that this word never means ‘wonderful' ‘as-
tonishing' as the word ‘extraordinary’ usually does nowadays.

eo...pateret] ‘had been content with that which lay open to every
citizen’. ,

3 latum] this was a privilegium (a law oi special application affecting
only individuals) carried by the ten tribunes in 5²· dispensing Caesar
from the obligatiou of a personal canvas for the consulship. This is the
beneficium populi mentioned below 5 3 and 9 5 e where see note.

Catone] cp. Liv. epit. ¹07 lex lata estut ratio absentis Caesaris in
petitione consulatur haberetur, invito et contradicente M. Caum.

extrahente] agrees with Catone, mora isan instrumental ablative
(‘by delay' or ‘obstruction'), conseatudine is a modal ablative ‘ac-
cording to his old habit’: cp. 33 5 3 sic tra'cluum disputationibus
excusanhnibusque extrahitur. Cato was a master of the art of Pariia·
mentary obstruction.

qui st...pronituissee] Pompey's vacillation in this matter was the
subject oi much uniavourable criticisml He let the measure pass though
manifestly opposed to his own interests, but later on in the year by the
lex Pompeia de inre magistratuum he caused the original rule. which the
proposal of the tribunes had set aside, to be reaffirmed. The Caesarian
Panis ‘’bieciissg 10 this. managed to have a special clause inserted

exempting Caesar from the operation of the rule. Suetonius Iul. ²8 y

says it was a mere oversight on Pompey’s part ( per oblivionum).
4 patientiam] ‘longsutseringt
