aede Apollinis, where he is probably referring to this occasion: cp. Luc.
111. 103· Merivale says they met in the temple of Bellona which was
also outside the pomerium, but this is less likely.

a legioms...X] it is difficult to sa'y how the ten legions are to be¹
reckoned, nor can we be sure that Pompey ever made the statement
here attributed to him by Caesar. He probably means the seven legions
in Spain, the two taken from Caesar, and the foroe under Domitius amount·
ing to about one more legion. Mommsen however, R. H. 1v. 389 toll,
believes that Pompey had about 10 legions in Italy without reckouing
the Spanish army, viz. three remaining from the levies of 55, the troops
raised in 52, and two withdrawn from Caesar. KH agreein excluding
the absent Spanish troops from the account, and suppose the number to
be made up by the forces raised by Pompey at the end of 50 (Appian, Β.
C. 11. 31, Plut. Ant. 5) and inthebeginning of this year 49. This view of
Mommsen’s is severely and, Ι think, justly criticised by M. Stofl'el,
Histoire de Jules cesar, 1. 207f011.; ep. Gb'ler Biirgerkrieg, p. a.

milites] Caesar's own troops; so Appian, B. C. 11. 30, says that
messengers ἰσχυρίζοντο τῷ Πομπηίῳ τὴν στρατιὰν Καίσαρος τετρυμένην τε
πόνῳ καὶ χρόνῳ, καὶ τὰ οἶκοι ποθοῦσαν, μεταθήσεσθαι πρὸς αὐτὸν ὅτε τὰ
Ἄλπεια διέλθοιενε cp. Plut. Caes. αι), There was no tmth in the
repon, except so faras it might be justified hythe defection of one of
Coesar's most trusted obicem, Labienus, which took place about this time.

aut sequautur saltem] ‘or at any rate follow him’ ie. if he wanted to
advance on Rome. saltem is only·nsed here in Caesar: cp. Cic. Ast
1x. 6 ἕ 5 eripe hunc dolorem aut minue saltem.

3 Faustus Sulla] L. Cornelius Sulla Faustus son of the dictator Sulla
who when he took the title of Felix gave his twin children the
appellatives Faustus aud Fausta. He married Pompey's daughter
Pompeia: in 46 he was killed in Africa by Caesar who spared his wife
and children; cp. Β. Af. 95.

Mauritaniam] the north-westem portion of Africa corresponding
to part of Morocco and Algeria. Bocchus, son of the Bocchus who
surrendered Jugurtha to the Dictator Sulla, was king of the eastern
portion and his brother (Ρ) Bogud of the western. By means of Faustus
Pompey might hope to establish friendly relations with these princes.

4 Iuba] King of Numidia. The extent of his dominious is described
in exaggerated language by Lucan tv. 670 foll. His political attitude
is stated in B. C. 11. 25 huic et paternum hosfiaum cum Pompeiae!
