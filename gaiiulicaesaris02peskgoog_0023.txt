Cicero were evidently distracted with anxiety‚ not knowing to
which side to attach themselves He exhorts the young Curio,
of whom he had a high opinion, to fit himself for public life,
apparently in the vain hope that he might guide the state

, through the troubles that threatened itl. In 52 he writes that

public affairs are getting into such a state that the most fortu-
