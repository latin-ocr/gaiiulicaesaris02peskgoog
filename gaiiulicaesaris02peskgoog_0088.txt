a difficult post to administer, and was therefore assigned to the most
suitable ex·consul avallable.

Philippus ct Cotta] L. Marcius Philippus, consul 56. He was
connected by marriage with ‘the Julian family, being the second
husband of Atia, mother of Augustus and daughter of Caesar’s sister
Julia and M. Atius Balbus. This would sufficiently account for his
being passed over in favour 'of the later consul Domitius. Similarly
L. Aurelius Cotta, consul 65, was passed over, Caesar’s mother having
been an Aurelia and possibly Cotta’s sister. The following genealogical
table will make this note clearer.

a plebiscitum, cp. ad pipulum feratur) conferring on them the imperium.
Of course before the passing of the lex Pompeia in 5², by which it was
enacted that there should be an interval of 5 years between the tenure
of office as consul or praetor and the provincial govemorship, the
imperium conferred by the lex cunata on the consul or praetor when
entering on his consulship or praetorship would not be interrupted, the
offices being continuone, and so would cover both the home and the
foreign administration3 but the magistrates here mentioned whose office
had expired some years would in the ordinary course of things require a
fresh decree of some sort (see Mommsen, Rechtsfrage, n. 116) conferring
the imperitior. ln the words quod superioribus annas amitere! Caesar
has in his mind the conferring of the imperium on the incoming consul
or praetor before 52, which imperium as stated above would not need
