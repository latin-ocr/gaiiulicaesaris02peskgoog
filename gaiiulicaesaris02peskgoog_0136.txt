= genitives citerrhnir provinciae, ulteriora Hr'spamiu, utriusque provinciae.
The objection to the word! Hispaniae of course is that Caesar would not
be likely to insert it directlyafter provinnue which could so easily be
supplied again with the adjective ulterion's.

LXXX] M . Stoffel, judging from the disposition of the Pompeian
forces in 83 ἓ r, thinks this number too large, and proposes to read
XXX.

a auxiltiz peditum V nrr'liu] the text here is in a hopelessly disordered
state: the reading here given is the one generally adopted and is to a
certain extent supported by Cicero Att. lx. 13 §4 nam ego hunc ita
paratum vrileo peditatu, equitatu, classibus, auxiliis Gallorum, quos
Matius ἐλάπιζεν, ut puto, scd certe dicebat pedrium decem mah, equitum
sex polliceri sumptu suo annos decem. lt will be seen that Cicero here
gives the exact double of the equitum III milia mentioned by Caesar,
and so agrees with Caesar's statement that he doubled his cavalry force

by raising 300⁰ horsemen in Gaul (parem ex Gallr'a numerum) ς and on
the same ground it is inferred that if the very doubtful reading peditum .

decem milia in Cicero be assumed correct we should be justified in
reading peditum V milia in Caesar.

quae] this is only found in one late trs, but improves the sense.
Caesar had 3000 cavalry during his previous campaigns, and he now
levies another 3009 from Gaul. Itis probable that the words parm cx
Gallia numerum also refer back to the (supposed) peditum V maiia, so
that we are to understand Caesar as meaning that he doubled the
infantry as well as the cavalry of his auxiliary force. The student will
notice how much suppositionis required to make any tolerable sense out
of a large portion of this chapter.

pacaverat] Caesar had crushed Gaul into submission hya war of nine
years duration3 this he calls ‘pacification'.

huc] the text is again defective: for huc the mss have hinc and
aster attingunt some words are lost ; adiecerat is a conjectural insertion:
one of the genitives optimi generis or hominum seems to depend on
some number that has been lost; this number may lie concealed in the
word irinc, or perhaps mille (written m) has fallen out after them
of hominum,- cp. 111. 84 ς 4 equitum atala KH take optimi generis as
a partitive genitive ‘isorne of) an excellent class of men ’‚ comparing 111.

4 ἕ 6 huc Dardanos...Macedones‚ Thessalos ac reliquarum gentium et
narratum adiecerat.

Aquitami] the Aquitani forming one of the three main divisions
of Gaul belonged to the Iberian race. They occupied the S.W. of Gaul
