carn xxix. xxx] NOTES. ’ 95

municipiorum] it is possible that the word maritimorum may have
fallen out aster municipiorum, for Caesar is evidently thinking only ol
the municipia on the coast, Tarentum, Sipontum, eto: see on 3² ὅ 1.

' uouendas] for deducere used of bringing a vessel into port cp, 36
ξ α, B. Al. 11 ς on the other hand it is more often used of launching a
ship, as in B. G. v. a.

a Sardiniam] Sardinia and Corsica together formed one of the 'Roman
provinces and were govemed by a propraetor, at this time Μ. Cotta.
Caesar was anxious to secure the three great com-producing countries
Sardinia, Sicily and Alrica, on which Rome was dependent forits
supplies of food τ cp. Appian B. C. 11. 40 ἑτέρους δ’ἔπεμπεν ἅμα Κοίντῳ
Οὐαλερίῳ Σαρδὼ τὴν νῆσον καταλαβεῖν πυροφοροῦσαν· καὶ κατέλαβον.

Curionem] Appian B. C. 11. 41 ἔς τε τὰ ἔξω, Κουρίωνα μὲν α’ντὶ
Κάτωνος ᾑρεῖτο ἡγεῖσθαι Σικελίας, Κόιντον δὲ Σαρδοῦς.

legionibus ll] this, not III, is no doubt right. The four legions
mentioned in 11. ²3 ἕ 1 are these two together with the two legions of
Domitius previously despatched to Sicily under Asinius Pollio: see
note on 25 ἕ a.

Africam] the Roman province of Africa corresponded roughly to
Tunis and part os Tripoli as sar as the greater Syrtes (Gulf of Sidra).

M. Cotto] M. Aurelius Cotta son of the like-named consul of γρ
Caesar despatched Valerius and Curio during the last week of March,
aiter the capture of Brundisium and before his arrival in Rome3 and he
says here that Cotta was expelled from Sardinia before Valerius leit
Italy. Hence the rumour that reached Cicero in May that Cotta was
still holding Sardinia must have been false, Cic Att. x. 165 3 Cato qui
Siciliam tenere uullo negotio potuit et, si tenuisset, omues boni od eum se
contulissent, Syracusis profectus est ante dr'rm m'ii K. Mai„ ut adme
Curuo scripsit. utinam, quod aiunt, Cotto Sordimmm meat! est enim
rumor: o, si id fioerz't, turpem Catonem!

sorte] cp. Cic. p. Lig. ar Tubrrmu's sorscouiecta est ex senatus
consulto ,· οἵ iusto cum imperio cosmatus consulto iu prouinciam ruam
venerat.

Tubero] L. Aelius Tubero was appointed by the Senate to govern
Africa as propraetor ior the year 49. The previous governor C.
Considius having abdicated before the expiration of his office had
insonnally delegated his powers to his legatus Q. Ligarius (Cic. p. Lig.
a), who on the news ol the outbreak oi war reaching Africa refirsed to
take any prominent part for Pompey, to whose interests the inhabitants
were devoted, and practically resigned his post. Thereupon P. Attius
