58 DE BELLO CI VILI. [rra. 1.

β socius] the Romans often granted these titles to friendly foreign
kings or chieftains, e.g. B. G. 1. 3 Catamantaloedes; 35, 43 Ariovistus;
tv. 12 the grandfather of Piso Aquitanus3 vlt. 310110v1003 cp. B. Al.
34 regna sambrum atquae amicorum. Juba was afterwards declared by
Caesar an enemy of the Roman people, but received distinctions and
the title 01 rex frorn Pompey, Dion xu1. 4²·

Marcellus...negat] the reason for his objection isdonbtful. Moberley
says “Marcellus stopped this measure probably because the combination
01 Bocchus with Jaba, even as allies of the senate, would be dangerous;
especially considering that a stoppage of the African corn-ships might
starve Rome, if events led the two kings to form such a plan”. The
German editors ignore the difficulty.

inpraesentia] I take this as abl. sing. 01 praesentata, so both Merguet
and Meusel in their Lexx. s. v.: others regard it as n. pl. 01 praesens.
[in praestruis first found in Livy, and the final u'se 01 in apart from
some verb such as venire to help it out is not classical. J. s. tt]

5 Philzppus] L. Marcius Philippus, praetor in 44, son of the consul
of 56, for whom see below. Cic. Phil. ιιι. 05 calls him vir patre avo

privatis] since the time 01 Sulla it had been usual for the consuls
and praetors to proceed to their provincial administrations on the
expiration of their term of office at Rome, but in 52 it was enacted
that for the future a period 01 five years should elapse between the
consulship or praetorship and the provincial administration; the regular
succession 01 provincial govemors under this rule would not begin till
48, and meanwhile the provinces had to be assigned to exconsuls or
err-praetors who had as yet held no provincial govemorships. The
exact method by which this was to be done cannot now be satisfactorily
determined 3 see Mommsen, Rechtsfrage, p. 45, n. i18. There were in
all 14 provinces to dispose 01.

Scipione] see note on r 54. The province 01 Syria bad been
assigned to M. Crassus in 55 for 5 years, together with the conduct
of the war against the Parthians. In 53 Crassus and his son were
defeated and slain. The position 01 Syria, exposed as it was to the

formidable power of the Parthians, sufficiently accounts for the pro·
minence assigned to it.
L. Domitio] L. Domitius Ahenobarbus, consul 54. The governor·
