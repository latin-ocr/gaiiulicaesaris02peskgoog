Kalendas eum is esset eum consulibus Teani. Cicero saw L. Caesar the
same day ²3 Jan. at Minturnae evidentlyron his way to the meeting
place Teanum. Immediately after the conference Pompey left for
Venafrum. The eonference seems to have been renewed at Capua on
the 25th 3 see note on 10 ἓ 4.

3 in Galliam excederet] this is not really airrepov πρότερον though it ·
looks like it. Caesar might of course return to Gaul and yet retain
possession of Ariminum. The Pompeiana wanted the hostile gar-rison
removed from Ariminum, and no doubt from the other towns, Pisaurum,
Ancona, Arretium, the news of the capture of which by Caesar had
reached Rome a week before. See note on 11 ἕ 4.

Crrav. XI.

1 iniqua] the terms were unfair in Caesar’s view for this reason, that he
was to disband his army and return to Gaul, while Pompey who was to
go to Spain was to be allowed to retain the two legions which did not
rightfully belong to him, havingbeen taken from Caesar (legiones
alienas). We must suppose that there was some stipulation of this
kind in the nltimatum sent by Pompey. The effect of it would be that
Pompey would have an armed force in Italy while Caesar would have
none. Ι cannot understand why Paul should substitute absentem for
alr'enas. KH seem to go equally astray in denying that precinunt means
the Spanish provinces.

dilectus habere] understand ipsum again from the last sentence: ‘to
want Caesar‘s army disbanded but to go on levying troops himself. As
Caesar was pushing forward his troops and occnpying towns in N. Italy

it was hardly unfair of Pompey to go on 'with his levies.

Pompey had secured himself against a charge of breaking his word even
