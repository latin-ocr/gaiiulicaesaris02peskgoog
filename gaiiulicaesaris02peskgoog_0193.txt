164 DE BELLO clueat.

gmorari atque iter impedire Mss3 Paul, comparing Β. G. v11. 40 iter
eorum nroratur atque impedit, reads impedire iter. The suggestion is
probable, but there would be no great difficulty in mentally supplying ,

eos with onerari. lf anychange is neededlshould prefer to transpose 1

atque and iter.

04 1 interrumpi tiss: Nipperdey irrumpi, Forchhammer iter interrumpi.

a ferri uss ; the editors agree in reading inferri.

4 tantae magnitudini fluminis a i, tantae magnitudinis fluminei Ο hl
(with flumini as a correction in 0): cp. magnitudo fluminis 505 1,
aquae magnitudo 40 ἓ 3, 50 ἓ a. The reading oi Ο tantae nragni·
tudinis flumini ‘to a river ol such size' would be equally good.

7 arara in flumine rass; Nipperdey abrepti ai fluminis, Diibner ablati
flumine. lt is difficult to account satisfactorily ior the corruption in
the uss.

Saddito ad vadum cn'rcuitu all uss except c, which places ad vadum
before fluminis, and so all recent editors. F orchhammer and Diibner
regard the words as a marginal gloss.

85 4rnontes intra se recipiebant uss, Nipperdey rightly montes intrare
cupiebant: apparently intrare was confused with intra se, then the
syllable re,'added as a correction, became attached to cupiebant.
Aldus read intra montes se recipiebant.

86 radaquandi causa Mss; this may be due to a confusion between
aquandi carisa and ad aquandum.

8¹7 4ad lucem multum perse Mss; most editors retain this with the
substitution os at ior ad. Τὴε whole sentence is strangely worded,
and there may be some deep-seated corruption. See my note.

6 evincit all MSS, but vincit occurs as a correction in O.

08 rexercitum educit rass3 Aldus restored ducit: the mistake arose from
the preceding edmit.

ainermesf, inanis ab, inermi h l; there is little or no authority ior
the form inermus in Caesar.

0⁹ inec necessarii l a i, nos nec necessarii h; read perhaps with Morus
nostros necessarii.

aconsr'lium sarem laudibus ferebant uss3 Pluygers and Paul read
efferebant comparing 111. 87 ἓ 1 Pompei consilium summai laudibus
effemt: in the present passage it is possible that we should read
suum summu.

ad iter uss3 prqficisci ad iter is an unusual it not unexampled
phrase: Paul alters the words to ab Ilerda. 1 agree with KH that no
change is needed: ‘having started (from the camp) for their journey’.
