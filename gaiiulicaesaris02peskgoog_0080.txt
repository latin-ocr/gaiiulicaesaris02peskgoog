capp, 11. nn] NOTES. 51

συνεγρᾶφη Dion xcx. 3. These proceedings took place on Jan. and,
'nxun .

Dlodicuntui] at this point, according to Plutarch Caes. 30, a proposal

was made by Antony, following the terma of Caesar's dispatch, that

both parties should lay down the imperium, and to this the senate gave

’ its assent, πάντες ὁμαλῶς προσεχώρησαν ; but Lentulus and Scipio, acting

in Pompey’s interest, stoutly opposed this, and the sittings carue to au
end.

Cnnr. ΙΙΙ.

r misso] the presiding magistrate used to dismiss the senate with some

such words as nihil vos teneo, patres conscrzpti. Ι

ad vesperum] this is the usual accusative 3 the ablative or rather
locutive is vesperi or vespere. The noun vespera is archaic and poetic.
It was apparently on this day a Jan. that the tribunes vetoed a resolu-
tion proposing 'that the senators should put on mourning‚ a practice
usually followed in a dangerous political crisis, but the senators dispensed
with the official authorisation, leaving the house sor the purpose oi
changing their garb. Dion xnl. 3, Plut Caes. 30.

evocantur] are summoned out ol the city.

laudat] a word seems wanted here to balance segniores3 it -would be
easy to supply promptos before Pompeius.

a ordinum] they were offered the post of centurion (ordo); ‘companies’
would be a fair, though not quite accurate, modern equivalent for the
word here: see more on 46 ξ 4.

evocantur] used in a slightly different sense srorn that which it bears .
in§ 1: here ‘called out to serve'3 such persons are called evocati as

belbvdcegssilntur] this verb and accerso which may be ol different origin

⁵ are perpetually confused iu the ross.

3 ipsum comitium] ‘even the comitium itself': this was a space
on the North-Eastern side os the sorum originally used lor public
meetings.

4 coguntur] cogere in senatum is the regular phrase sor summoning
members to attend the senate, the attendance being (theoretically)
compulsory: cp. Cic. Phil. 1. 11 quid tandem erat caussae cur ἐκ sena-
tum bestamo die tom acerbe cogerer? Caesar here refers to the meeting
os the senate on Jan. 5th, there was no meeting on the 3rd and 4th3 see
note on 554.

5 vero] vero in the third clause, like denr'que, denotes the climax.

4-2
