between the ocean, the upper course oi the Garonne, M. Corbieres und
the Pyrenees.

3 audimat] the beginning ol the sentence is apparently lost and with it
the subject of audierat, possibly Varro. The report about Pompey’s
approach was baseless.

sumpsit] KH consider that the subject oi this sentence as well as of
the last is some other thau Caesar.

4 quad...deainxii] this does not imply that the officers were wavering
in their allegiance, but that their enthusiasm would be stimulated by the
knowledge that only by a victory and the oonsequent spoils oi war

1 paretes] these no doubt crossed the Segre between Ilerda and the
confluence oi the Noguera Rivagorzana with the Segre about 6 miles
(ro kilometres) Nn. oi Ilerda. Caesar says they were 4 miles apert,
and we may fairly assume that the lower bridge was about 3 kil
above Ilerda, and the upper about rlril. below the junction oi the two
rivers. M. Stoffel places Fabius’ camp on the right bank near the lower
bridge and about a rniles N. oi Ilerda l adopt this view as to the
situation ol the camp and bridges‚ aiter careiul consideration, in pre·
serence to that oi Herr Schneider who places the lower bridge, together
with the camp adjacent, near the confluence oi the rivers, and so at
a distance of about 10 kil. irorn Ilerda, and the upper bridge 4 miles
lartber up stream.

iris pardius] ablative of way or directi0n3 cp. B. G. v. 19 amniim
viis semitisque essedarios cx silvis emiteiat ,· Roby 3 1176.

a hac idemsere] ‘something os the same kind': cp. B. G. vr. 17 debir
eandem sere quam reliquae genter opimmnem habent. But Dr Reid
prefers to take sere with the verb furebant.

Pompeiam] the Pompeiau troops crossed by a bridge oi their own
(cp. ς 4 suo parete) which connected Ilerda with the opposite banle It

was made of stone, cp. Lucan lv. 15 saxeus ingenii quem pares amplat·
