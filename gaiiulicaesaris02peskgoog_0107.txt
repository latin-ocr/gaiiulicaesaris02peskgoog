78 DE BELLO CI VILI. [nm. 1.

the pay of a common soldier (4 obols instead of a), he probably expected
also double the reward (8 iugera instead of 4). In the corrupt passage
B. G. v111. 4, ducenos sestertios, centurimilus tot milia nummum, I have
suggested centurionibus bis totidem nummos. The above scale of pay
was doubled by Caesar, but at what date is uncertain; Suet. Caes. 26.
[In Livy the distribution of money at a triumph is almost always-so
much for the common soldier-double for the centurio-triple for the
eques. On the foundation of the Latin colony of Aquileia tria millia
peditum quinquagena iugera, centuriones centena, centena quadragena
(al. quinquagena) equites acceperant, Livy xl.. 34. At Bononia
(xxxvrr. 57) equites 70 iugera, all the rest 50 ; so at Vibo (xxxv. 4ο)
pedites 15 iugera, equites all 30. In the burgess colonies the division
seems to have been uniform. J. S. ru]

euocatisque] these were legionarias who had served their time and
were called out again3 cp. 3, ἓ 3.

Curi. XVIII.

r quod oppidum] referring to Sulmo which, though not expressed‚ may
be regarded as inherent in the name Sulmonenses ‘inhabitants of Sulmo ’.
KH quote 111. 805 1, Gomphi, quod est oppidum, etc. cp. Reid on Cic.
Acad. 11. 103.

easacerc quoe vellet] this phrase probably denoting ‘submission' does
not occur elsewhere in Caesar, but is found in B. Af. 7legati...libenter
se omnia facturos quae vellet pollicentur. But perhaps it simply means
‘do what he wished ', ‘carry out his desires’. A frequent expression
in the sense of submission is imperata facere or something similar, cp.
above 13 5 a quae imperaverit (⁴shall have ordered') se cupidissime
facturos pollicentur ,· for the tense of vellet (‘should wish’) cp. B. G. vn.
90, legati...quae imperaret (should order’) se facturos polluentur.

Q. Lucretio] mentioned in Cic. Att. vn. 24, 25.

Atts'o] to be distinguished from P. Attius Varus ra 5 3 etc.

a portas aperuerunt] cp. Cic. Att. vm. 4 5 3 Sulmone C. Atium
Pelignnm aperuisse Antom'o portas, cum essent colones quinque (Caesar
says septem), Q. Lucretium inde effugisse scis, Gnaeum ire Brundisium,
l· Domitium desertum Ἡ confecta res est.

3 se deiecerunt] with the object of escaping, not of committing suicide

mitteretur] notice imperfect subj. after the historic present petit.
