APPENDJX. 167

this passage es corrupt, but see note. Nipperdey proposes neque tot
tantaque auxilie parata, Paul reads neque equitatus peditatusque tanta
auxilia parata, too wide a departure from the MSS.
8 praeside MSS: Aldus restored premeret.
tot annos Ο h l, tot annis a s; either would be correct, cp· B. C.
111. 59 ἕ 1 qui principatum in α’νιῖαίι multis annis (all MSS)
obtinuerat, B. G. 1. 3 regnum iu Sequanis multos annos obtinuerat.
9ut semper fit per paucos Mss; Aldus altered fit to scd, and recent
editors follow him; perhaps we should read ut semper fit, scd etc.
etiam omitted in hlf. ’
quod MSS, quom Nipperdey, quin Madvig, Paul, KH.
ra sed si id sit sactum MSS; sedis ol course wrong, it was perhaps
originally a corruption ossi id.

00 4sacramentum all Mss except h l which have sacramento,· this may
be right, but cp. ²3 5 5 where all MSS have sacramentum, and 11. 28
§a sacrammti quod...dixr'ssmt.

8⁷ 1 quid MSS, quod Nipperdey and most editors.

qui antiseraut MSS, except f which has amiserint: the indicative
is not incorrect.
restituat MSS: Stephanus restored restituatur.
a intus MSS, except b which has iustius: Guilelmus restored in ius.
3 flagitaretur MSS, Dinte13 Aldus and other editors flagitarentur.
postulatum est MSS, except a which omits cst, and ‘two interior
Mss’ which have postulant. Dinter reads postularunt, which is
necessary to the sense itflagr'taretur be read; with flagitarentur we
may retain postulatum est.
