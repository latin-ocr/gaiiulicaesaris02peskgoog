latin and was supplanted by aas. The word denotas all the various

apparatus osa campe teuts, baggage, etc. According to Polybius vr. ¹
4ο, when a camp was broken up three signals were given3 at the first
the paclring up began; at the second, the baggage ready packed was
plaoed on the waggons or beasts, and at the third the army began to
move. The word conclamari must refer to the human voice and not to
the sound ol au insument, cp. 111. 1⁰5 5 3 tantus aereum clamer et
rigerem sonas: no doubt when the trumpet sounded at the general's
headquarters the necessary orders were given in a loud voice by the
officers all over the camp to their men, and it is to this shouting that the
word applies. For the whole expression cp. 111. 37 §4 ere coeutaneatis
quidem vasis, 38 ὅ ι vastique militari mere catulamatr's: osten we find
vasa collegere used of moving camp, as inLiv. xxr. 47. Probably the 4
orderwasgiven in the words vasa colligite. ’

the usual meaning of exaudire, cp. B. G. vr. 39 with my note.

while serving as' Antony's legate in Syria in 40 was defeated and siaiu by
an irruption os the Parthians, who were assisted (qaiftrror scelerum! as
Florus says 11. 18 9 4) by the Roman Labienus. According to another
account he committed suicide. Cicero osten speaks os him with ab
horrenoe in the Philippics, cp. Phil. xr. rr accedit Saxa msera qur's, quem
notis Caesar ex ultima Celtiberia tribunum plebis dedit, castrorum antea
metator, nunc, ut sperat, urbr's.

. 4 quinque...campestn's] ‘the next interveniug 5 miles afforded a march
over easy ground'. The word campestris must not be too strictly l
interpreted3 there was no level plain in the neighbourhood, but the ¹

ground might be called campestres as opposed to the rugged mountainous
district lying 5 miles south.
