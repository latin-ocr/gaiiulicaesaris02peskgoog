rao DE BELLO CI VJLI. [ctu 1.

a cuiusque generis] probably the genitive at'ter huminum, ‘men oi every
sort’.
cum...uteretnr] ‘as each followed ’, or ‘each following’. ,
superiorum] ‘using the license oi former days and former journeysl. l
3 senatorum...equestris] ‘sons os senators and men os equestrium rank'g
the phrase is in apposition to and in explanation ot' honesti adulescentes.
flumina] the Segre and its tributary streams.
4 sese...expedr'uut] ‘rally'.
· 5 dum...prtuit] ‘so long as tlre struggle could be conducted on an equal
footing ’‚ i.e. so long as only cavalry were opposed to cavalry.
nestinuere] ‘one oi the few passages where Caesar uses this form
oi the periect’, KH, who quote B. G. 111. ar catere, Β. C. 111. 63 §6
MCC-ism·
6 magnum...mamentum] ‘was ol great moment for the saiety ol our
men': the resistance offered by the cavalry gave time for the main body
to withdraw to the neighbouring heights.
calanum] ‘camp followers'.
impedimentorum] probably ‘beasts of burden’: cp. note on 40 ἓ 3.

Cnar. LII.

r tamen] ‘notwithstanding'2 the favourable circumstances mentioned
at the end oi the last chapter were counterbalanced by the serious dearth
os provisions. But perhaps lum should be read for tamen.

amnibus] the neuter ablative is not osten used for omnebus rebus ‚· sor .
instances see Draeger H. S. 1. θ ar, Reid on Cic. Am. ἕ 23.

quae...cansuem't] ‘a thing which invariably increases’ (⁴ grows ’
worse’)‚ ‘not merely from the present dearth but also srom the sear sor
the luture’.

a denarum L] Ar. 155. 5d., the deuterius being equal to aad. The
market price ol corn atthis time seems to have been between 3 and 4
sesterces, that is, just under one denarius; cp. Cic. Verr. 111. ἐς 163,

196. The Roman madius was about a quarter ol a bushel.

p. 29. 3 er tam] if the reading be right, tam may be taken either with
paucis dr'ebus ‘in so few days', in which case the following ut must be
considered as equivalent to r‘ta ut ‘so that’; or, notwithstanding the
intervening paucis diebus, with magna ‘so great’, in which case an ita
must be mentally supplied with inclinaverat because tam cannot quality

verbs. The difficulty is obviated by altering et tam to ita, as suggested
by Meusel and adopted by Paul.
