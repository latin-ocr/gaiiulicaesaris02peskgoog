114 DE BELLO CI VILI. [Lus. r.

locum iniquum] the hill on which Ilerdais built is precipitous and

difficult of access except on the s.W‚ side, where there is a slope ·

leading up from the plain to the top of the plateau and partly enclosed
. by two projecting spurs of rock, oue ol which, that on the S.E. side oi

the slope, forms a long narrow and steepledge. The men of the IXth ’

. incautiously pursuing the retreating Pompeians up this slope found ζ

themselves, when the latter turned to bay under the walls of the town,
iu an extremely critical situation. They were hemmed in on the ·
narrow slope by the two flanking spurs of rock and exposed to a shower
of missiles from the enemy who were on higher ground and had the
walls of the town at their back. To retreat down the slope would ot
course be fatal. Nothing was leit lor thern to do but to hold their
position as well as they could.

, 4 promptus] ‘the place was precipitous withasteep descent on either

side'. This describes the two walls oi rock running downwards from
the town and skirting the slope on either side. For the juxtaposition oi
the words praeruptus and derectus cp. 11. ²4 ἓ 3 id autem art iugum
derectum, eminens in mare, unaque cx parte praeruptum atque asperum
latitudinem] the extreme width os the slope near the lower end
measured between the lateral escerpments of the two spurs of rock is
stated by M. Stoffel to be about 340 yards: nulli telum va'brarr uacabat
says Lucan iv. 40.

battle array’: notice that eum would have been sufficient without the
addition of locuir'r.

tenurit thus used, though Hotoman and Paul read leni comparing 11. 24 l

yards or about 400 paces.

nitebantur] ‘struggled'‚ fstrove': virtute and patientiis are modal
ablatives, ‘with courage and eudurance’: it would not make such good
sense to take them as ablativos after ructantur meaning ‘they relied on
their courage aud endurance', though this would be grammatically
possible, cp. Β. G.vl11. ro tamen Germanorum adventu barbari nete·
