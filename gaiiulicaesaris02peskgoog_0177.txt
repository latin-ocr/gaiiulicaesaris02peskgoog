three lines, 4 in the first, 3 in the second, and 3 in the third.
suae cuiusque legionis] probably cuiusque does not agree with legione,
but is the genitive stiterit, thus stra cuimque legio means ‘the particular
legion of each (cohort) ’. KH however take cuimque to be iu agreement

corrodantur] 'were included in’. The expression isso vague that
it is impossible to say exactly how they were placed. I should be
inclined to take media ocior as meaning the second oi the three lines,
