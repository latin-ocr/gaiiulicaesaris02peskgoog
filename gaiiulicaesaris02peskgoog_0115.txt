Histonium (Vasto, on the Adriatic coast) to Teanum in Apulia ou the
south hanlr oi the Frento. From thence he would probably go by
Arpi (Cic. Att. rx. 3 ἓ a), Canusium, Barium (Bari), Egnatia (near
Mouopolil, and so to Brundisium. ldare not follow General Gdler in
giving the exact stage for each day, or in stating at what part of the
joumey the troops were halted for a day's rest l

1). 14· 1 luceria] Pompey was at Canusium ou the aoth (Cic. Art. vlu. .
11 ὅ 4) and probably leit Luceria, (now Lucera) ou the 18th, after
receiving Domitius’ letter on the 17th (cic. Art. v111.6 θ o, 121) 5 r)
announcing the investment os Corfinium. 1t is not therefore strictly
correct to say that Pompey lest Luceria ‘on learning of these events
which had happened at Corfinium ', for when he lest he could not have
had news of more than the first two days at most of the siege.

Canusium] Canosa just S. of the Aufidus (orante). Pompey leli
Canusium on the arst; cp. Cic. Au. vm. 145 1, 1x. r ἕ 1.

Brundisium] the well-known Brindisi, then, as now, a great port of
embarkatiori. Pompey arrived there 25 Fen, cp. Cic. Att. 1x. 10 §8
ΚΛΜ, cum ille quintum iam diem andr'sii esra. ἢ

a coprus] Pompey now organises his new levies. It will be remem-
bered that the only regular troops he had with him were the two
legions taken from Caesar: oi these, ¹4 cohorts had been in camp at
Luceria, two had been sent on to Brundisium under Metellus Scipio,
and the remaining four were at Canusium: cp. Cic. Att. vru- 3 ἓ 7,
r'an§a‚1rc§2.

3 L. Manlius] sumamed Torquatus, one of the praetors os 49.

Alba] the Marsic Alba Fucentia (15 ξ 7). It seems strange that
Caesar should have advanced from Corfinium leaving a hostile garrison
oi six cohorts behind him. Moberley takes this to be the Alba in
Latium, but “Alba in Latium was no place at this time ; had the site
oi old Alba been meant Caesar would have written ex monte Albano or
something os the sort.” J. s. R.

Rutilius Lupus] Cic. Att.1x. 1 5 a (written 6 March) urbem quidem
iam rgfertam esse optimatium audin Sosium et Lupum, qnos Gnaeus
noster anie putabat Brundisium vmturos esse quam se, ius digere.
Later on Lupus was holding Achaia for Pompey B. C. 111. 56.

Tarracina] Terracina, formerly called Anxur, in Latium on the
coast between cape Circello and Gaeta
