’ 90 ns uarro cruror. yur. 1.

ab utroque latere] the side towards Brundisium and the side facing
the open sea, in other words, the sides facing np and down channel.

cratibus acpluter's] ‘fascines and screens’3 the latter were breastworlrs
of wickerwork covered with raw hides: cp. 111. ²4 5 r scaphas...cuatibus
pluteisquscoutexit.

10 tabulatorum] ‘stories ’ς these towers sometimes had ro stories as in

Β. G. vrri. 41, aud exceeded roo ft. in height.

excitabat] ‘ran np‘z the word suggests hasty construction and is
elsewhere applied by Caesar to the erection of towers, B. G. 111. 14,
v. 40,V111.9. ·

eurr. XXVI.

r adornabat] ‘proceeded to equip'.

ibo] ‘on them’=in eir; cp. 27 δ 3 aud a similar use of eo 111. 2431
eoque milites delectos imposuit where eo=iu cas (scaphas).

arm tomis] the use of the preposition is strange, and is scarcely
defended by such phrases as acm ueste, cum telo etc.

, tormentis] see note on 17 § 3.

amni puero telorum] ‘every kind of weapons’; in B. G. vn. μ
multitudine...omuis generis telos-mn the phrase seems to be reversed
‘weapons of every kind ’.

appollebat] ‘brought up close ’.

a ita] ita thus followed by ut (⁶ in such a way that ’) has something of
a concessive force: ‘Caesar though carrying on these operations did
not think that negotiatione for peace ought to be dropped ’.

Magnum] from this remark and from the subsequent account of the
final closing of the negotiations we should naturally gether that Pompey
never seut back Magius at all, yet it is clear that he did so from
Caesar‘s own letter to Oppius, Cic. Att. rx. 13 Α ἕ 1 Pompeios est
Brundisii: misit ad me N. Magium de poce ; quae uisa sunt respondi:
so too Cicero says Att. rx. 13 ᾗ 8 Pompeius N. Magium de poce mint,
ettamen oppugnatur. KH would 'solve the contradiction by supposing
that Pompey bad sent him back with instructions, to which Caesar had
replied, and that then Pompey refrained from sending him on a second
mission. But this is pure guessworlr and contrary to the whole tenor
of the narrative. ·1t is simpler to suppose that Caesar here, whether
from forgetfulness or deliberately, makes a false statement.

ea res] his exertions to bring about an understandiuga translate

freely ‘and although his frequent attempts in this direction hindered‘
etc.
