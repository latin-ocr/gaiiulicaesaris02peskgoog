96 DE BELLO CI VILL [nin. 1.

Varus, who happened to be in Africa whither he had fled straight from
Auximum (cp. 13 ἐξ a, 33 3152), took Ligarius‘ plaoe and becarm to
all intents and purposes the governor of the province, of which indeed he
had formerly been propraetor. Tubero then on arriving in Africa found
his post already occupied and was not allowed to land, as we read in
the next chapter. It is for this reason that Caesar here says obtinere
debrbm‘ ought to have been iu command of’, instead of obtinebat. At
a later period Tubero‘s son impeached Ligarius for bearing arms against
Caesar. Ligarius was successfully defended by Cicero in a speech
which is still extant.

3 Caralitam] the people of Caralis, now Cagliari, on the S. coast ol
Sardinia.

simul] for simul atque only here and in Β. G. tv. 26, whereas the
fuller form occurs ro times. The usage is common in other writers

profecto] sc. illo ,· for the omission of the pronoun KH cp. Β. G. tv.
ra resistentibus sc. eis.

4 Cato] the account here given by Caesar of Cato’s proceedings is
slightly at variance with that given by Appian Β. C. 11. 40, 41, who
says that Cato left Sicily on the arrival of Asinius Pollio whom Caesar
had despatched at the same time as Valerius to Sardinia, and that
afterwards on reaching Rome Caesar nominated Curio governor of
Sicily in place of Cato. According to Plutarch Cato 53, it was the
arrival of Asinius Pollio together with tlte news of a larger sorcc
advancing that forced Cato to leave Sicily: this helps to combine the
two accounts: the truth being that Cato did not retire immediately on
the arrival of Pollio with Domitius¹ cohorts, but only when he heard
that there was a fresh force coming; see below adventu Curr'om's cognito.
He left 23 April, cp. Cic. Att. x. 16 quoted above onss a.

naves longas veteres] naves longasis regarded almost as one word to

peninsula southward from Thurium ; the Lucani stretched northward
