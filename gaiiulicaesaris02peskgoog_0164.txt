Cnnr. LXIX. l

1 prosequebantur] ‘pursued our men with insulting cries’= prosequi
aliquem aliqua re is to accompany or escort a person with something;
generally it is used in a more favourable sense than here, cp. B. G. 11. 5
Caesar Remos cohortatus liberaliterque oratim prosecutus.

necessarii..1reoerlr] the accusative and infinitivo clause represents the
substance 01 their eries.

videbatur] they appeared at first to be going towards Ilerda, but
afterwards wheeled round and marched southward.

a consillum...serebout] ‘extolled their own policy': cp. 111. 87 5 1

adiuvabat.

ad iter prrrseclos] ⁴ starting lor their joumey ’t Paul alters al iter to ab
Ilerda, forgetting that viderant would then be almost certainly required
instead 01 vellebant.

3 retorqueo] it is not quite clear how much 01 Caesar’s march was in
view 01 the Afranians3 11 it be supposed that the whole 01 it srom the
moment 01 leaving the camp was executed in their sight, the last part 01
my note on magua circuilu 68 5 1 must be modified accordingly. I
think it probable however that Caesar’s column when it first wheeled
to the right was under cover 01 the hills and so out 01 sight 01 the
enemy. ln that case the words retorqueri addextrare will refer not to
the initial stage 01 the southward movement, but to the subsequent
gradual reappearance 01 the column moving towards the right over the
rising ground.

priores] the vanguard.

superare regionem castrorum] ‘passing by (outflauking) the site 01
their own camp '.

fugiens laboris] this genitive after fugietis is not quoted from any
other classical author. It may be compared with such expressions as
Hor. Od. 11. 9. 18 desine mollium landem querelarum, Roby§ 13383
see also sor other somewhat similar genitives Roby §d 1318, 1320.
