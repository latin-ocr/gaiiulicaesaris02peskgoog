quibus..potuit] Jan. 3rd, 4th, yth, are marked C (Comitialis dies) in
the Calendar, on which days it was against the rulelor a sitting of the
senate to be held, hut in certain cases this rule could be dispensed with,
as eg. when the senate was summoned late in the day alter the comittit
⁶ were over (Cic. Att. 1. ¹4 ἕ 5), or when the day in question was a market
day (nundinae) or an extraordinary holiday: so on this occasion there
was a session ol the senate on the yth as well as on Jan. rst, and, 5th,
6th. Mommsen, Staatsrecht 111. 2, p. 922 loll.

1 entra urbem] or, as it is elsewhere expressed, outside the pomerium,
cp. Dion XLI. gilo-repon δὲ ἔξω τοῦ πωμηρῐου πρὸς αὐτὸν τὸν Πομπήιον
ἐλθόντες ταραχήν τε εἶναι ἔγνωσαν nnn. The precise nature of the
pommhm is disputed but it may be taken in a general way to mean the
boundary lineos a town or seulement, the ground within which was
consecrated and so marked off from the surrounding ager. It originated‚
according to Varro Lingua Latina v. 143, in the old Etmscan habitos
drawing a line round anew settlement with a plough and a yoke of
oxen3 the trench cut by the plough was called the fossa and the lineos
earth thrown up on the inner side the murus, then the line or strip
of ground behind, ie. inside (according to some, outside) the wall was
called the pos-merium or ponarium (cp. pomeridzbnus); sometimes the
word denoted the whole os the interior space, so that pomerium and
urbs were almost equivalent. As the state grew the pomerium had to
be moved farther outwards, and this was done by Sulla and by Caesar.

The reason for the senate meeting outside the walls was to secure .

the presence of Pompey who as proconsul and armed with the inperium
ι could not enter the city. The place where they met was the temple of
Apollo built about 430 ne. just outside the porta Carmmtali53 cp. Cic.
