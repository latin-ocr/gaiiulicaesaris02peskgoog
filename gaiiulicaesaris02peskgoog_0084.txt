cic. leg 111. aa quam ob rem'in ista qurilem re vehementer Sullam
probo, qui tribunis plebis sua lege iniuriae faciendae potestatem ademerit,
auxilii ferendi reliquerit ; Vell· 11. 30, Appian B. C. 1. 59, 1003 see
below 7 ἐξ a, 3. [Caesar must be exaggerating in his reference to Sulla,
is the statements are true that Sulla restricted the tribunes to the
auxilii latre. One cannot believe that Sulla would have allowed
validity to the use os the intercessio which these tribunes attempted.
J· s. ul
a septimo dr'e] on Jan. yth, but they entered on office on Dec. roth,
hence Caesar means on the seventh day after the beginning of the policy
inaugurated by the new consuls on Jan. rst.
quod] this is the object of respicere and refers to de sesa salute cogitare ,-
the words ac timere a‘re added ns a sort os asterthought.
post octo denique nrenses] Moberley refers to the case os Tib. Gracchus
who was killed in about the eighth mouth os his tribunate. He might
also have referred to M. Livius Drusus who was murdered in the ninth
month of his tribunate in uc. 91. The text however is corrupt.
artabrum] cp. Liv. v. rr tribuni celebrare neturus: ‘official acts '.
respicere uc tintere] the same words in B. G. vm. ay.
² 3 extremum atque ultimum] so sur as there is any difference between
these words perhaps extremum marks a thing as being the last of a
series while ultimum brings out in a stronger degree its finality; cp.
Cic. Fin. 1. rr quaemur, quid sit finis, quid extremum, quid ultimum. ⁴
senatus cuinullum] this decree, the terms oi which are given below,
was ‘a purely negative measure, the setting aside os constitutional
checlrs which stand in the way of the preservation of the state’ (Nissen).
It had been issued in 52 and in 63, as well as ou other occasions,
when the position of affairs was hardly more critical than in this
year 49. Caesar is probably trying to mislead his readers ; see note
0¹¹ 7 i 5·
omnium salutis] a double genitive after desperatione ‘amid the
general despair of saiety’.
sceleratorum ακάαιιὶι] a probable conjecture: ‘through the audacity
ot wiclred men '.
quipus pro consulibus] ‘und those who in the place of consuls' i.e.
' ‘and those proconsuls who'; the noun proceruul is merely a convenient
form to express the more strictly correct pro canule. In decrees of this
kind sometimes no magistrates except the consuls are mentioned.
p. 4. 4 perscribuntur] decrees were always recorded in wn'ting with the
signatures of witnesses appended‚ who were said scribendo adesse.
