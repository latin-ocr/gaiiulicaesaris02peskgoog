postulavisset] the demand was first made through C· Curio in 50,
Cic. Art. v111. ι4 ἕ a fert illam tamen condicionem ut ambo exercitus
tradant ,- it was repeated in the letter to the senate io Jan. 49, see
above 9 5 3 tort, Suet. Caes. ²9 sertatum litteris deprecatus est, nc sibi
bemficium populi adimeretur, aut ut ceteri quoquc imperatores ab exerd·
tibus discederent.

facturus esset] ‘was ready to make '.

5 ab altero] from one ol the two rivals, that is, from Caesar himself:
they demanded that Caesar should disbaod his army, but refused in
their own case-(in sc), in other words, they refused his proposal that
each party should disarm.

cornio permisceri] so the Pompeians accused Caesar turbare omnia
ac permiscere uoluisse, Suet. Caes. 30. The phrase denotes ‘general
confusion ', cp. omnio confundere Cic. Acad. 11. 53, with Dr Reid’s note.

1219. 6 legionibus] see note on a ἓ 3.

circumscribendis] ‘circumscribing the freedom ol’, ‘ putting restraint
on’, ‘infringing the liberties of ¹: the word means ‘to draw a line round’

‘these events ’.

rempublicam suscipiunt] ‘undertake the charge os the state '.

8 deessset] this may refer to some remark made by Pompey in the

’ course of the proceedings narrated in 6: it had been urged, as we learn
brom 3 ξ 7, that an official deputation should be sent to Caesar, and this
may have led to Pompey’s remark that to send envoys attributes too
much importance to the person to whom they are sent and argues sear
on the part ol the sender.

tenuis] ‘poor’.

operibus] probably ‘actions ’, ‘deeds’: KH qu. [ἰν. t. ι6 lois
immortalibus editis operibus.

studuerit] perfect subjunctive=studui in direct speech

cunr. XXXIII.

r rem] the words de mrttncdis legatis are added as explanatory ot' rem,·
‘the senate approves the matter, namely, about the sending ol envoys':
there is something similar in ao ἓ 4 quae ignorabant de L. Domitii fuga.
