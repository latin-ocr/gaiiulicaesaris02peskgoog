74 DE BELLO CI VILI. [orn. 1.

the Aedui, perhaps at Matisco (Micon). Stoffel reckons that it would
take it 35 days to march from Micon to where it overtoolr (consequatur)
Caesar between Auximum and Asculum, a distance ol about 620 miles.
Hence he concludes that the courier summoning the legion must have
been sent srom Ravenna as early as 21 Dec.

preficiscr'lur] Caesar probably marched by Firmum (Fermol a lew
miles from the coast, and Truentum a town at the mouth of the Truen-
tus (Tronto). See on 165 1.

Asculum] Aseoli on the Tronto, destroyed iu the social war 91.
LS are wrong in referring to Florus ι. 18 5 9, as the town there spoken
os is Asculum or Ausculum in Apulia where there was a battle between
Pyrrhus and the Romans.

Spinther] P. Cornelius Lentulus Spinther, aedile 63 (Sall. Cat. 47),
consul 57. He was a firm friend and supportet of Cicero,

X cohortibus] this expression is used in preference to the more
obvious una legione no doubt because these cohorts were contingents
srom different legions, or recently levied at different times aud places
and not yet incorporated into one homogeueous body: cp. B. G.
v. 9.

adventu] Stoffel makes it appear probable that aventus here signi-
fies ‘approach' rather than ‘arrival’, as Lentulus seems to have lest
Asculum on the 5th while Caesar did not reach it till the 8th. Τὴε
addition too of cognito rather supports this view3 and see note on 16
§a 30 b s·

4 Rufum] L. Vibullius Rufus, a Pompeian but highly respected by
Caesar into whose hands he twice fell, once at Corfinium 34 ᾗ 1, and
again in Spain 111. 1051aud1. 86 ὅ 3.

hominum] ‘the people there '‚ ‘the inhabitants’: cp. 5 ἓ 5.

5 Camerino] a town in the Umbrian Apennines, now Camerino,
situated on the road to Ancona.

Lucilium Hirrum] one of the tribunes ol 53.

excr'yott] ‘takes up ’, picks up’: cp. B. G.vl1.¹18 quos ille...ex sugo
excepit.

XIII] Pompey in a letter to Cicero of ro Feb. (or, according to
M. Stoffel, the 11th) says ἐς (Q. Fabius) nuntiat L. Domitium cum suis
cohortibus XII etcum cohortibus XIV, quas Vibullius adduxit, ad me
lter habere;...C. Himem cum V cohortibus subsequi: thus making the
total of Vibullius’ and Hirms' forces ¹9 cohorts, whereas Caesar makes
the number 13. Caesar does not say how many cohorts Vibullius
received from Lentulus nor how many he got together from the levies
