enen. unxit—nxxw] NOTES. 139

consileontibus] consiliari is only used by Caesar here and in 19 5 r,
and is rare in other authors.

3 cohortium alariarum] auxiliary cohorts‚ the auxiliaries ol the allies
being always stationed on the wings of the army, and called ola metra
and sinistra.- cp. 835 r, 11. 18 5 r, B. G. 1. 5¹·

aquom] this water supply was evidently some way oti, but we do
not know its exact position. Stpffel says there is now no water in the
district, except in reservoirs. A stream marked in Schneider's map and
called Llobregds en Fine, it it really exists or did exist, would answer
the requirentents ol the passage, being about 5 miles Nn. oi Mayals.

Char. LXXIV.

r notum] practically a substantive, ‘acquaintance’3 so below 5 6.
municipem] ‘t'ellow·townsman ', so duis often means ‘felloweitizen't
the compounds concivis communiceps were very little used, and do not ¹
occur in classical authors.
conquirit] ‘enquires after ³, very much like our colloquial phrase
‘looks up'.
a pride'e] cp. 72.
beneficio] ‘through their kindness’, ‘thanlrs to them’3 cp. B. G. 1. 5 3
sortium beneficio se esse incolumem, Β. C. 11. 32 5 8, 111. 18 5 4.
quaerunt] ‘they enquire about ’, cp. Β. G. 1. 18 quasn't cx solo eo
quoe in conventu dixeram see note on 67 513 two other instances of
quaerere with accusative, Β. G. 1. 18 eodem quaeret and B. C. 11. 39
5 3 reliqua quaerere, are not necessarily similer, these being possibly
cognate accusatives. Here Madvig reads with great probability deinde
de imperatoris fide quaenunt.
illc] ‘to him '.
contulerint] orreo conferre cnm aliquo ‘to engage in conflict with’,
cp. Livy xxt. r nanc neque validiores opibus ullae inter se civitates
gentesque contulerunt armo. Elsewhere in Caesar orma conferre means
to collect arms, as in Β. G. vn. ια aenea conferri, equos produn, obniies
dori iubet.
3 fidem...petunt] ‘exact a solemn promise ’.

p. 39. confirmatis] ‘these conditions having been settled': the ablative
absolute may possibly be equivalent to a conditional sentence ‘it
these conditions are settled ', as Moberley takes it. Notice the near
repetition oi confirmare, which seems a mark os hasty writing.

signo translaturos] cp. ²4 5 3. 60 5 4.
