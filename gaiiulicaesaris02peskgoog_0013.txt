viii PREFACE.

Die Rechtsfrage zwischen Ciisar und dem Senate‚ Lange's
Rdmische Alterthiimer‚ H. F. Pelham’s article ‘Rome' in
the Encyclopaedia Britannica.- To these I may now add
Prof. Tyrrell’s interesting slretch of the political history of
this period in the Introduction to the third volume of his
edition of Cicero's Letters. To Dr J. S. Reid I arn much
indebted for his hindness in reading through a portion of
my notes and sending me many useful additions and
corrections. I only regret that owing to pressure of time Ι
was not able to submit to him the notes on more than 40
chapters.

I may mention that in the division of the chapters into
sections I have followed» the arrangement of Nipperdey¹,
which is also adopted by Paul and by Meusel in his Lexicon.
The fact that Meusel has adopted it in a work the utility of
which depends so much on facility of reference should make
it incumbent on all future editors to follow the same
distribution, even though it may not be in all respects as
satisfactory as one could wish.

Four maps or plans accompany this edition. Two of
them, the plan of Brundisium and the map of the segre, are
outlined, without details, from those given in Stoffel’s
Atlas.

Ι have added an Introduction, the object of which is
merely to give a brief slretch of the events that led up to
the Civil War. In an appendix will be found alist of the
more important variations of the uss and of some of the
alterations of the text that have been proposed.
