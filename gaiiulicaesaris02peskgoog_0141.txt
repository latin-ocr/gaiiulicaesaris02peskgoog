tumulus] this is the Puig Bordel, a slight eminence in the plain
between Ilerda and the site 01 Afranins’ camp.

a ocnepavisset] ‘should occupy'3 literally‚ ‘should have occupied ', the
act being regarded from the point 01 view 01 the ensning result. So in
such sentences as ‘he offers a reward to auyone who should do this ', we
should wn'te infecisset, lit. ‘should have done this '.

3 legiones III] we know from the subsequent narrative that two oi
these were the IXth and the Xthh.

nnius legionis] the Xthh.

antesignanos] what the antesignani were isa question that has been
much debated and perhaps does not now admit 01 solution. Three
views may here be mentioned: (i) 'lhey were the iour cohorts forming
the first line 01 the legion, drawn up in front 01 the signa, behind which
came the other two lines, consisting 01 three cohorts each The number
01 the antesignani would thus be {th (ἠώς) 01 the whole legion, which,
assuming the Xthh legion to have contained 30⁰0 men (Stoliel's
estimem), would be 1200. (ii) They were the two iront ranks 01 the ten
eohorts which were drawn up in one line, 8 ranks deep. 'lhe 30 regna 01
the different maniples (ol which there were three to a cohort) were
carried in the second rank, and the men 01 this rank as wellas 01 the
first were called antesignani, while the remaining 6 ranlrs were post·
signam. Ii the legion contained 3000 men, the two iront ranks would
contain {ths or {th 01 the whole, that is, 750 men. This isti. Stoffel’s
view which he developes at some length vol. 11. p. 3²9 1011. (rii) 'lhey
were not any definite portion 01 a legion, but were merely a body of

’ men 01 uncertain number picked from the legion and employed in any

sudden emergency where there was need 01 a small force oi tn‘ed

courage and able to execute rapid movements. Whichever 01 these
views be adopted, and I incline to the first, it will be seen that the

antesignani were reckoned the best soldiers in the legion. On the Ι ,

whole subJect see MM. V. 34² 1011. ; Geler, Biirgerlrrieg p. 36 1011,

4 breviare itinere] Caesar's three legions were apparently drawn apin
a line fronting Ilerda, Puig Bordel and Gardeny, the XIVth being on
the lest 01 his position arrd so the farthest from Gardeny and the IXth in
the centre. The antesignani were suddenly detached from the XIVth
to seiae Bordel but were anticipated by the cohorts 01 Afranius which
were not so lar 011.

5 aliis submissis subsidiis] ‘when other reserves had been sent up ',

by Afranius to assist his cohorts that had occupied the mound.
