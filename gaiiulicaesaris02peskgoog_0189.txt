160 DE BELLO CI VILI.

80 1 The word Hispaniae is worse than useless after the previous pro·
vinciae aud should no doubt be ejected as a gloss. Nipperdey goes
too far, 1 think, iu omitting the three genitivos citerioris provinciae,
ulterioris Hc'spanc'cae, and utriusque provinciae. Madvig would omit
only the words ulterioris Hispaniae. The text of this chapter is in a
sadly disordered condition.

aad VI milia auxilia perlitum milia most uss. The number VI is

right as denoti'ng the number of legions sent into Spain by Caesar3
hence the words ad and millia should probably be omitted. Then a
numeral seems to be lost between pedincm and milra,· this should
probably be V, cp. Cic. Att. 1x. 13 ξ 4. E. Hoffmann reads prae·
miserat VI: ad illa (⁸ in addition to these ’) auxilia pedc'tnrn V milia.

onradus MSS, except d which has quae omnibm which is probably
correct.

quarn ipse pacaverat MSS, rightly 1 think, as Caesar uses this
expression in reference to the subjugation of a country, cp. B. G. 111.
28 amsii Gallia pacata, etc. Paul writes equitnm tria milia manibus
supman'lus belles habuerat et parem cx Gallia numerum ipse paraverat
nominatim ete. E. Hoffmann equr'tunc trra milia, qnae omnibus
superioribus bellis habuerat et parem ex Gallia numerum quern ipse
paraverat nancinatim etc.

huic MSS, linc most editors, et linc (‘and out of them') E.
Hoffmaun3 others suppose some number such as CCCC (Mengc) to
be concealed in this word. 1 have thought it possible that M (mille)
may have fallen out after lentinum.

attingunt audc'erat russ3 one word at least seems to have fallen
out after attingunt somewhat similar in form to audlerat, perhaps
adiecerat or addc'dcrat. Possibly the subject of andurat bas also been
lost.

⁴0 gcangressae MSS3 egressae Iurinius rightly, cp. correptis for ereptis in
254. ¹

propria legiones MSS, except a, which has proprio relegroncn·
Nipperdey's restoration propiare ponte legiones is no doubt right.
E. Hoffmann (retaining congressae) prefers prate priores regiones.

impedimentaque MSS, see note: Paul iumentaque.
iumentorum uss absurdly for vi uentorum which is found ina
Norwich MS.
4legianes IVh li, legiones IIIa b; the latter is right.

⁴1 1 noctu f hl, nocte a; as an adverbia] expression of time without any

adjunet the former is more common in Caesar than the latter.
