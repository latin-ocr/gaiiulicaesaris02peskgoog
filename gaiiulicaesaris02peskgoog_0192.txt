APPENDIX. 163

3rtcrtri does not occur in the nss; if written compendiously it might

easily be absorbed by the ni of the previous word.

neque dum ctiam Mss3 the phrase is rather awkward with turn
etiem immediately following, but I‘see no reason to regard it as
corrupt.

⁵0 alonge Mss; most editors longo. The ablative may be defended by
B. G. tv. ro Rhenus...longo spatio per fines Nantuatium...citatur
fertur. Meusel retaining longe alters angaeus to angrunbre to agree
with sputu.

3 practer consuetudinem omnium Mss3 as Caesar does not. elsewhere
add omnium to the phrase praeter consuetudinem Paul would read
omnine, but 1 do not think the change is necessary.

constituerant Mss; Meusel‚ Paul, Dinter, imtiiuerant sor no valid
reason.

σο oinscquuntur nss; as insequi generally means ‘hostili animo sequi’‚
Meusel and Paul would read sequuntur here and sequebatur in 11.
38 ἓ 33 but in other writers insequi osten means ‘to follow ’, ‘to
come next ’‚ and Caesar himsell uses the participle insequens in this
sense with annus and dics. I see no reason therefore to alter the
text.

οι cipri Iocis excedere Mss; the addition oi hir or iis before or aster locis
is hardly necessary.

3abscntis tinniant MSS, inserting Pompei between manserem! and

. megru's. All editors since Daris agree in placing the name after
absentia.

4ccnquircrc Totogcsma Mss3 editors conquirerer! Octogcsam; Hotoman
conquiri which would malie the sentence more regular, but departs
more widely from the reading ol the nss.
abcrat XX ttss; geographica} considerations require that XXX
should be read. Numerals of this lrind are oi course peculiarly liable
to corruption in MSS.
castraque Of, castra hla, muniuntur all nss. 1· read with Paul·
castra niuniuntur, other editors castra muniunt.

02 1 reduxerat rem Mss3 Caesar always deducere rem, hence Paul reads
deduxerat rem. 1 prefer rem deduxerat, which is written re' &duxerat
would easily be corrupted to reduxerat and then rem would be added,
In all other passages in Caesar the noun precedes the verb.

tartaream& exceptbwhich has exstarent et, no doubt rightly. · ⁶
0⁸ r casira coniungunth l f, iungunt a b 3 the former is read by Paul and ·
