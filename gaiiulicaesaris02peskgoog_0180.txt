those constructed hy the Massilians (56), and lastly the fleet oi boats
ordered by Afranius to be prepared on the Ebro (61 5 4).
p. 45. summissos] ‘sent to the finnt'r verbs ol ‘sending’ or ‘going’com

pounded with sub often convey the idea of taking or sending assistance,
cp. subvehere, subnrincitrare, subvenire, succurrere, etc.; Roby ἕ ar 3⁸·

Sertorian war in 7² ne.

sative. θα) *2²¹ ῥ’ ’“ '‘ ω ’ “
Νιιί idem...abtr'neal] this is in part a repetition ol the complaint in
13 ὅ r, where seenote· ,
abseeu] ‘absent from them’ ie. the provinces3 Paul substitutes absentem
ior alunas in 13 ς 1, where however it seems less suitable than here.
