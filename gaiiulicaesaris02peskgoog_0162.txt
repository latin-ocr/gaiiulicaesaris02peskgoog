enee. nxvr. val1.] NOTES.

Crrnr. LXVII.

r consilio] ‘a council of war ’‚ cp. 11. 3051 quatra de caruis conniti)
convocato. A council of this kind usually consisted of the legati, the
tribunt militum and the centuriones.

tenpusprosectionir quaeritur] we should say ‘they discuss the proper
time for departure’: lit. ‘they look for '. ‘enquire about': cp. 74 ἦ a,
11. 14 ἓ 1 nt hostes sine fide tempus atque occasionem frondis oc doli
quaerum B. G. vrr. 37 ratio perficnndi quaesitum· viu. 47 corm'lia
belli quaerentibus.

censebant, ut] Caesar has cernere with ut 5 times, and with gerundial
construction 9 times.

a Μὰ noctu] ‘the day before at night ’, ie. ‘the previous night': see
below prima luce postridie ‘early the next morning ’.

quod...esset] ‘the fact that the cry had been raised ' ; there is no need
for Caesar to specify what the cry was.

3 timori...consuleee] ‘pay regard to their fears rather than the obliga-
tion of their osth': soldiers took an oath of allegiance swamentum to
their commender. Ina civil war, when they were fighting against their ·
fellow citizens, they would not feel this oath so binding on their
consciences as if they were fighting against enemies of the republic.

, 4 atlucem11 print this difficolt sentence as it stands in the mss with
the trifling change of ad to at. But the words omnium oculas give no
satisfactory sense, and Paul's insertion of sub before ente does not help
us much. Possibly some such words as intentes ad pugnam have fallen
out before omnium oculis, the repeated pu of pudorem and paginam
having caused the copyist’s eye to strayz cp. B. G. 111. 16 omnium aare
amatusque ad pugrrnm intentis. Translate ‘but the daylight of itself
brings with it a considerable sense of honour, when the battle iswaged

, before the eyes of all; much too is afforded by the presence of the
military tribunes and the centurions ’.

quibus rebus] loosely referring to the conditions mentioned in the

, previous sentence-the public gane and the presence of the officers.

quibus...soleanf] notice that Caesar might well have written ntilr'tes

’ (acmsative) and solere, this being a relative clause in oratio obliqua.

’ Possibly however he uses quibus rebus in a slightly causal sense,
equivalent to cum eis rebus, and not in the merely eonnective sense of

acereta. On such sentences see Reid on Cic. Acad. 1. 41 3 cp. B. G.
vn. 39 quodsuturum peniteat.
