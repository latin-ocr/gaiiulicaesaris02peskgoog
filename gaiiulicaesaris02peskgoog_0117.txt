16 5 3ς Plut. Pomp. 61, Cato 533 Appiau B. C. 11. 40. On the
arrival os the 19 (i) Domitian cohorts under the command of Asinius
Pollio, Cato lelt tlre island and repaired to Pompey at Dyrrachium. It
is noticeable that Pompey had intended sending these cohorts to Sicily
whither they were now dispatched by his rival Caesar, Cic. Att. vr11.
ra Α 5 3. Stollel (1. ³04) on inadequate grounds considers this clause a
late interpolation ; see note on 30 5 a.

Dyrrachium] now Durnzzo, a seaport in Albania, the ancient
Epidamnus; it was the usual port ol embarlration on the east ol the
Adriatic corresponding to Brundisium on the west. The consuls took
30 cohorts across with them (Plut. Pomp. 62), so that Pompey’s whole
force amounted to 50 cohorts, or about agnou men. Cicero Att. 1x.6
5 3 reckons the total at 3o,ooo which may include auxiliary troops and ’
cavalry.

3 extremis] ‘furthest’, ie. from Rome, Brundisium being situated in
the heel ol the peninsula; it should probably be repeated with regrbmibur
‘'the most outlying districts oi Greeoe’, cp. B. At. 77 Thebanmes...in
extrema eius regni regione maritima locati. The ablative could not
stand here without a preposition, so Paul inserts ab, ex lras been ,
suggested but would sound badly. Pompey by occupying Brundisium
and Dyrrachium would practically command the whole ol the Adriatic
from (ab) these two extreme points. Dr Reid thinks extremisis corrupt
and may have arisen frum ex maritimis, which would maire better sense.

an inopia] this was the real reason, cp. Dion xnr. ra iterii] γὰρ τὰ
πλοῖα οὐκ ἐξὴμκεσέ σφισι, προέπεμψεν ἄλλους re eal emir ὑπάτους, μή eal
νεοχμόσωσῐ τι rarii χώραν ὑπομείναντες.

4 administraturum] ‘the working ol the harbour’ (Moberleyt

5 fauces] just off Brundisium the sea flows in between the lines of shore
that slowly converge till a channel ol 350 yards minimum width is
formed3 the banks then recede again on either hand, the sea spreading
into two diverging streams, enclosing between them a projecting spur oi
the mainland, on the extremity ol which is situated Brundisium, exactly
opposite the above-mentioned channel.

moles atque aggerem] ‘piers and a darn ’. Cicero (Att. nu 14 5 ι)
gives the following extract from a letter written by Caesar to Q. Pedius,
received ¹4 March3 Pompeius se oppido tenen nos ad pertas castra
habemus. canamuropus magnum et naulterum dierum propter altitudinem
