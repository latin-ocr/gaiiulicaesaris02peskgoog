104 DE BELLO CI VILI. [nm. 1.

C. Trebonium] originally a supportet of the aristocratic party he
early espoused the cause of Caesar, and in his tribunate, 55, he proposed
the lex Trebonia by which Caesar’s tenure of the provincial governor·
ships of the two Gauls and Illyricum was prolonged for another five
years. He was made one of Caesar’s legati and is often mentioued in
the Gallie War. He was afterwards one of the conspirators, and was
finally murdered by Dolabella in 43.

Cute. XXXVII.

r C. Fabium] see note on 18 ἓ 5. When we last hear of Fabius,
B. G. vni. 54, he was stationed in winter quarters among the Aedui.
Probably the same despatch which ordered him to send a legion to
Caesar in Italy also directed him to shift his headquarters to Narbo.
The date on which he left Narbo cannot be determined, but is con·
jectured to have been about ro May. He would take from ro to
ra days to reach Ilerda, a distance of about 2²4 miles.

' saltus lyrenaeos] ‘the passes of the Pyrenees' ε the ordinary route
from Narbonese Gaul to Spain probably lay from Narbo through
Ruscino (Perpignan) and by the foot of the Puy Camellas through la
Jnnquera, and southwards to Barcino (Barcelona) and Tarraco (Tarra-
gona). 'lbere was another pass to the west of this by the valley of the
Tet, see below. ἕ 3· ¹

L. Aframb] consul in 60 when he must according to the law have
been at least 43 years of age, which would make him not less than
54 at this date. When Pompey in 55 rec'eived the control of the
Spanish provinces for '5 years he entrusted their administration to
Afranius and Petreius ς cp. Veli. Pat. 11. 48. r.

a reliquas legiones] this no doubt refers to the three veterau legions
which had been under Caesar’s command in Italy, the VIIIth‚ XIIth,
and XIIIth. Caesar would thus have 6 veteran legions for the war
in spain3 cp. 39 ἓ a Caesar legiones in Hispaniam praenestem sex.

3 ex saltu deiecit] Stoifel and Gbler agree that the pass here men·
tioned is that crossed by the road which, brauching off from Perpignan
to the right, follows the valley of the Tet up to Puigcerda and then
descends 011 the other side by the valley of the Segre or Sicoris to

Urgel. But R. Schneider, Ilerda, pp. r-3‚ maintains that Fabius took
the route above mentioned by Jnnquera and Gerena.
