138 DE BELLo CI VILI. [ulo. 1.

cmtunones who had come to urge Caesar to light, 71 §a Notioe that
latin has no word ο1 general signification quite corresponding to our
‘officcr ¹, though daea sometimes approaches it, cp. 735 1 duces adver·
sanorum.

non probabatur] ‘did not commend itsell' to’ ε plerisque is dative, the
construction being probare aliquid aluid. But Caesm might have
written a plerisque as 74 ἓ 7 consiliumque eires o cunctis prolatatum
B. G.111. ²4 hoc conuta'o probato ab ducilem and see quotation innote
on 58 ἓ 3.

degreditur] Caesar presumably occupied some slightly rising ground
not lar from Afranius. But perhaps digreditur ‘moves away irom’
should be read.

5 praesuiis...dispositis] this ablative expresses the method by which

all the routes were blocked‚ and is therefore subordinate to tlte other
ablative absolute omm' intercluso r'tinere.

cuir. LXXIII.

i postero die] apparently 28 July.

spem] the slight hamhness ο1 the phrase stertinio Hune· spem ‘hope
of (about) the river', ie. ‘hope ο1 reaching the river'‚ is sostened by the
proximity ο1 the more natural genitive rei frumentariae ‘hope ol pro·
visions’.

consultabant] Caesar has conmltore three times and only with de,
cp. Β. G. v. 53, vn. 77: but consulere only once with de, B. G. 1. 53 de
se temonibus consultum dicebat.

r εἰ reveni vellent] ‘in ease they should choose': these lonsely
attached hypothetical clauses are not nncommon in Caesar, especially
with posse, but I find no instance quite like the present where the
main clause does not express some action on the part oi the subject
oi the sentence: eg. it would have been quite regular 11 caestu had
written unum ostendit iter etc. ‘he points out to them one route, in
case they wished' etc. Something similar is 84 §a polam si colloqui
vellent, concessum est.

Tanacoom] it is not clear whether they proposed td reach
Tarragona by way ο1 Granadella and Reus, crossing the higher part
ο1 the Sierra de la Llena‚ or by retuming some little distance on the
way to Lerida end then striking the present route lrom Lerida to
Tarragona by way ol Borjas and Monblanch; probably the former.
