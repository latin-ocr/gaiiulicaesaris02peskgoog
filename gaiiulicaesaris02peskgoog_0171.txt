CHAP. LXXVII.

· a magnoin bonore] cp. 111. 47 ἕ 7 pterea..moguo r'n boum habebant,·
sometimes the in is omitted, cp. Β. G. V. 54 quos praemitur semper
honore Coerarbobuit.

priores ordines] ‘their former posts' or ‘centuries', ordo being osten ·
equivalent to centurie.

equites...bonorem] beware of confusing the equites Romani with the
ordinary cavalry serving in the Roman armies5 the latt'er at this period
was not composed of Roman citizens at all, but was drawn from the
allies. The equites here mentioned are Roman knights, who occasionally
joined the army and served as tribuni militum and praefecti ,· hence
Caesar says that he restored these knights od tribunicium honorent, ie.
to the posts of tabunt militum which they had previously held in
Pompey’s army. So too in Β. G. 111. 7 the prefects and military

ccpbr'om...uou nullom] ‘a certain quantity', that is, a fairly large
amount; so uon nulli homines means ‘several men’, not ‘scarcely
any men’. Hence Stoffel is wrong in saying ‘ils n’en avaient plus
qu'une petite quantitt’.

XXII] I agree with the majority of commentators in thinking this
number Iar too large ; the Afranians had only lest Ilerda 4 or 5 days
before, and if they had had provisions for 17 days remaining, there
would have 'been plenty to spare sor the cetrati and auanbt'ares. But
instead of altering it to VIII with Gbler or VII with Dioter, I
should prefer XII as accounting better sor the corruption. We know
from Cic. Tusc. 11. 37 that Roman soldiers often carried plur quarn
