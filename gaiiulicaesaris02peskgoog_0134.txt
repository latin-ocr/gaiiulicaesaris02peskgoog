Varro]¹ M. Terentius Varro, best known ior his extraordinary ern·
dition and his voluminous works, of which unfortunately the greater
part have perished, was a strong supportet oi the senatorial¹ party, but
aiter the decisive battle at Pharsalia he surrendered to Caesar and

about 66. The destruction oi his valuable library at Casinum by
Antony is referred to by Cicero Phil. 11. 5 ¹03·

Hispaniam citen'orem] it is perhaps impoaeible to give the exact
limits oi this province at this period, but it may be roughly described as
comprising the whole of the north-castam portion oi Spain from the
Bay os Biscay to the Sierra de Morena (saltus Castulonensis) and
Cartagena.

alter] notice that alter refers to Varro and tertius to Petreius though
they had previously been mentioned in reverse order: this is a mark oi
hasty writing (ΚΗ).

ultumum] this province comprlsed most or all of the rest of Spain
not included in Hispania citerior; it had two main divisions‚ one called
Baetica, that is, the country between the saltus Castulonensis, with its
south-eastern exterminus, and the river Anas (Guadiana); the other
called Lusitania, for which see below. At a later period Lusitania was
made a distinct province, the name Hispania ulterior being reserved ior
the abridged province of Baetica.

Wuonum] the Vettones occupied a district about covering the
provinces of Caceres and salamanca, between the Durius (Douro)
and the Anas. '

Lusitaniam] the third main division oi Roman Hispania, comprising
the country bounded by the Durius, the sea, and the Anas. The
extreme north-vestem corner oi Spain, Gallaecia and Asturia, may have
been considered at this time as belonging to Lusitania.

Sicoris (Segre).
