Cure. I.

Ρ. 1· 1 Caesare] the text is uncertain and we should perhaps read
with H. Nissen litteris Caesaris a C. Fabio consulibus redditas, in which
case Fabius, who was a trusted legate oi Caesar osten mentioned in

B. G. vnn, must be supposed to have accompanied C. Scribonius Curio
who is elsewhere spoken os as the bearer os the letter, as in Dion
Cassius xu. 66, xm. 13 Appiam B. C. 11. 3²5 cp. Cic. Fam. xvr. 11
§a nurnine et ipse Caesar anricus noster minaces ad senatum ct arabas
litteras uerterat et erat adhuc impudens qui exercitum etprovinciam invito
senatu teneret, et Curio nicus illum incitabat.

consulibus] C. Claudius Marcellus and L. Cornelius Lentulus Crus.
The former was a cousin of the C. Marcellus who was consul in 50 and
brother of M. Marcellus consul in 51. Caesaris relating the proceedings
in the senate house on 1 Jan. 49 rae.

tribunorum] the tribunes particularly referred to are Q. Cassius
Longinus, formerly quaestor to Pompey‚ and M. Antonius. With
great difficulty they persuaded the consuls to read the letter to the
senate, but could not induce them to make any definite statement on the
immediate subject of the letter (cx litteris referre ad senatum). Pro·
bably the tribunes and others kept shouting refer! refer l, cp. Cic. Cat.
1. ao. The tribunes were originally only allowed a seat outside the
—door oi the senate house whence they might watch the proceedings; at
a later period, probably in the second century u.c.‚ they gained the
privilege ol becoming members oi the senate and the ius referendi.
