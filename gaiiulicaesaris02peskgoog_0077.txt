48 DE BELLO CI VILL [nra 1.

a referrent] it was usual for the new consuls at the beginning of th'e
year to make a general ¹ reference’ to the senate on public affairs, each
senator in turn being asked to state his views, quid fieri placeat. I
object to Hotoman’s infim'te in place of the corrupt in civitate on the
ground that if the word had been in ordinary use we should find it

audacter ac fortiter] ⁴ with boldness and resolution'.

sentoatias dicere] ‘express their opinions' on the point submitted to Α

3 ut fecerint]=ut feci'stis in oratio recta. Among the previous occasions
referred to, Lentulus may be thinking of the debate in November 50
when the senate voted by 370 to aa in favour of Curio’s proposed,
or of the crowd of senators who waited on Caesar during his winter

gratiam sequantur] cp. amicitiam sequi 60 5 5, Β. G. vn. 6 3.

4 Scittio] Q. Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio, son of Cornelius Scipio
and adopted by Q. Caecilius Metellus Pius He was consul with Pompey
for the last five months of the year 52, and in that year Pompey married
his daughter Cornelia widow of Publius Crassus.

eius]=Pampei.

Carae. 11.

1 aderat] the sentence is unsatisfactory-whether one reads aderat or
aberat: with aderat, meaning ‘was in the neighbourhood ’, Caesar would

have expresscd himself more logically had he written baec Sczyam's
oratio, quad Pompeius aberat, ex ipsius dac-3 while with aberat meaning
