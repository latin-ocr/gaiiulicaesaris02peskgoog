conservative ultras, impracticable men such as Cato and others,
wedded to ancient forms and habits of thought, and unable to
accommodate themselves to new views and changing situations.
These men were of course bitter opponents of Caesar. A few
references to Cicero's letters will help to throw light on the keen
political strife which marked the closing years of the Roman
republic. Writing in 59 Cicero inveighs bitterly against the
triumvirate3 ashort time ago, he'says, it was agreeable to the

is gone for ever2. ln 56 and 5 5 we find him drawing nearerto the
triumvirs‚ as he recognises the impracticabilityof the optimates.
Now, he says, Ι approve of everything that Pompey does. All
freedom of action is gone. We want repose, which our rulers
are likely to give us if certain persons (Cato and others) could
bring themselves to acquiesce more quietly in their supremacy³.
In 54 we find him making approaches to Caesar and to Crassus;
he remarks that all patronage is in the hands of Caesar4 ln

vacillation were fast alienating many of his supportem, Cicero
calls him ille perennis inimicus amicorum suorumf, but for all

abandoned the mass of law-abiding citizens, from which he
draws the conclusion that all wise citizens should now change

rivals now began to show themselves, and there were frequent
rumours of an impending dictatorship. Moderate men like
