APPENDJX. 159

B. C. 11. ²3 ἕ 1, 37 §⁴2 but there the forces of Domitius are included.
· Curio only took two legions with him to Spain, hence read II with
Ciacconius and most recent editors.
5 imperatusimis all MSS, except thatl has impen'tirsimur as a correc-
‘ tion; I agree with Meusel in thinking that imparatissimus should be
read. The corruption is easily accounted lor by mamilation to the
preceding ablativa. “

’ 81 3.I retain the reading nithe Mss in terra.

82 5 quadab altero aon postularent h l, alterarum postularent a b; the varia
tions point to the loss oi some word between altaro and postularent.
olegibus Mss3 Aldus restored legionibus.
aa 4tempus mim all uss except 0 which has mittat,- the editors
generally acoept Nipperdey’s amitat: Paul dimittat.

' ³⁴ 1 missum a Pompeio niss3 most editors aiter Aldus write murum in

ffispaniam, cp. 38 ἓ 1. Nipperdey refers to 111. 2251 from which it
appears that Milo who was in exile at Massilia had received instruc·
tions lrom Vibullius. But this in itseli would not be an argument
against the words in Hispaniam, sinoe a person on his way irom
Italy to Spain might well pass through Massilia 1 prefer however
to retain the reading oi the MSS, on the ground that missum, ‘had
been despatched‘, ¹ had been sent on a mission', would make sufficient
sense without the addition of the destination.

a Sigila' MSS, the s having adhered lrom quas.

4 adse vacaverant nrss ς read perhaps evocavemnt as Paul suggests.

5 in amnibus castellas af h, ex Ο (prima mann), l omits the preposition.
So Paul. “

r 86 gpartes duas hlt; this seems more forciblc than duas partas the

reading of a, adopted by most editors.
4alter bella victas Gallias arss; most editors adopt the conjecture ol
Glandorpius victos Sallyas, which would seem to require that the
’ second alter should refer to Pompeius though he is mentioned first.
Madvig proposed alter ballo vr'cta Gallu adem tailusn't, which Paul
adopts with the substitution oi alra adnluarit lor eadent mluait. 1
accept this reading in default ol a better.
80 3 urbis accidant Mss; the editors rightly urbr's, si accidat.
88 1 ‘lhe words tribus legionibus altar ulteriorem do not occur in any trs
but are necessary to the sense. They were first inserted by Nipperdey.
The omission is easily accounted lor by the similarity ol the words
&meam and ulteriorem
3 totius arse, a mistalre due to Lusitaniae being regarded as a genitive.
