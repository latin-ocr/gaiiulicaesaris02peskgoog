82 ’ DE narro cruval. [m. 1.

Cnhr. XXI.

1 magur] a genitive of value, perhaps originally a locative; see also
note on iuteresse ²4 ἓ 5. ·
oppido patin] the ablative is usual with patiri in Caesar, with the
doubtful exception of B. G. 1. 3, where the genitive is found, and
of 11. 7 potiundi oppidi, 111. 6 potiundorum oppidorum, where the form

v os the phrase implies an accusative.

qua] nominative agreeing with commutatae.

momentis] this metaphor from the dipping of a scale is frequent,
cp. 111. 68 5 1 sed fhrtuua, quae plurimum potest cum in reliquis
rebus tum praecipue iu bello, paruis momentis magnas rerum commuta·
tiones effia't.

intercederent] the idea conveyed hythe word is that of an event
‘interposing’ itself in the ordinary course of affairs. The mood is due
to the fact that Caesar's thought is here expressed3 ‘because as he
reflected‚ great crises often occurred from a slight disturbance of
equilibrium'.

3 perpetuis] ‘withan unbroken line of sentries and outposts’.

omnem mune'tebnem] ‘the whole line of investment’‚
4 praefectos] ‘cavalry officers’.
caveant] jussive subjunctive atter hortatur: there is no need to
supply ut.

5 qui...cauquieverit] qui=ut ts, and therefore this sentence gives an
instance of the perfect in a consecutive clause following a perfect in the
main clause; though Draeger H. S. 1. 5 133 says that there are no
instances of this in the B. C. He quotes 5 from the B. G„ as
eg. 11. ar temporis tauta suit exiguitas...ut ad galeas induendas tempus
defieertt.

6 summae retum] ‘the ultimate issne’, ‘the crisis of their fortunes‘:
cp. 11. 30 9 r, 111. 51 54, B. Al. 16.

expectatio] almost ‘anxiety abont'; cp. 111. 19 5 4 magnaque erat t

expectatae eim rei.

mente atque auimo] a stereotyped phrase in which all distinction
between the two words is lost sight of, as in our expression ‘with all
one’s heart and soul’. Properly speaking the meres is the intellectual

part of the animus: cp. B. G. 111. 19, vr. 5, and often in Cicero und ἵ

Lucretius.
quid..,acce'deret...exciaerent] ‘(in suspense as to) what was happening
