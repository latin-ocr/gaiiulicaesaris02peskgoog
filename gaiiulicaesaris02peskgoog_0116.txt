transferunt] cp. 74 ἐ 3 se statim sagita translaturos confirmant and
60 ἓ 4 transit etiam cohors Illurgavonensis ad eum cognim amatu
consilio et sagrus eu statione transfert where transire and signa tramferre
occur together as in the present passage. Cicero Ast. rx. 6 ὅ ι says he
has heard sex cobortes, quae Albae ficissent, ad Curium aaa eunucu
tramisso. stoffel thinks the junction may have taken place near Arpi,
the ruins of which are close to the modern town oi Foggia. Caesar
was at Arpi on r March, Cic. Att. 1x. 352.

4 reliquis itineribus] ‘during the remaining stages '.

agmen] the main body oi troops on the march ; they would probably
be preceded by the cavalry.

Cremona] ‘oi Cremona ¹, ablative oi origin3 cp. 111. 71 C. Flegi-
uatem Placentia, Α. Granium Puteolis, M. Sacrativirum Capua .· with
this one may compare the common nse oi the ablative to denote the
tribe to which a person belongs as Q. Verres Romulea ‘oi the tribe
Romilia ⁹.

praefectus fabrum] ‘chiei engineer officer'. An army in the field
was always accompanied bynu organised corps oi engineers‚ fabri,
iumished with all the necessary appliances ior siege operatium, bridge
building etc. Caesar mentions his arrest and dismissal oi Magius iu a
letter to Oppius, Cic. Att. tx. 705 a.

5 interesse rei publicae] the genitive aiter interesse is probably depen-
dent on a neuter noun understood, ‘it is among (the advantages] oi the
state '‚ ie. ‘it is one oi the iuterests oi the state '. So too it is suggested
that in such phrases as mea interest, the word mea isnot, as it is usually
taken to be, a feminine ablative singular, bnt a neuter accusative plural,
so that the meaning is ‘it is among my interests'‚ inter mea est.
