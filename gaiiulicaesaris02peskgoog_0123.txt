94 DE BELLO CIVILl. [urs. 1.

exact diflerence between a scapha and a trister, but probably the former
was larger and better built than the latter.
reprehendunt] ‘checlr', ‘hinder their escape'.

Crine. XXIX.

r ad rpem] lit. ‘for the hope', but we should say ‘iu the hope'.

aias rei mam] ‘the delay involved in such a course’.

a relinquebatur] ‘the only course left was' etc.; cp. below 63 ὅ n,
B. G. v. 9 relabquebntur, ut...pateretur.

picem] these would be merchant vessels belonging to Ancona and
other small ports on the coast of Picenum.

freto] the Sicilian struit, which, as the strait best known to the
Romans, was often called fretum without any addition. KH suppose
that Caesar meant the ships which had conveyed the troops of Domitius
to Sicily.

impeditum] ‘fraught with hindrances’.

3 oderem exercitum] it will be remembered that Pompey had a veteran
army of 7 legions in Spain, the two Spanish provinces having been
assigned to him for 5 years from 1 Jau. 55 by the Iex Trebenna.

altera] the reference is to Hispania citerior, where, in conjunction
with Q. Caecilius Metellus the governor of Hispania ulterior, Pompey
had brought the Sertorian war to a successful conclusion in 7²· Alter
the death of Sertorius most of the towns of hither Spain voluntarily
surrendered to Pompey, who doubtless did his best to restore prosperity
to the afflicted country and so earned the gratitude of the inhabitants.

Crrar. XXX.

1 Hispanianr] “Caesar’s resolution to go to Spain arose from an
almost instinctive feeling in a Roman general, prevailing since the
time of the Second Punic War, leading them to consider Spain as
important as Italy itself. See Arnold, Hist. Rome, vol. 111. p. ⁸13
where this point is well brought out ” (Moberley).

duumviros] see note on 23 5 4: the duumviri are probably the two
IVviri iure dicundo there mentioned who may bave been also termed
IIvira' iure dicundo. As Dr Reid says, these magistrates were probably
called duoviri, the form duumviri (duum being an older form related to

duorum as nummum to numerorum) haring perhaps been expanded
from the abbreviation Ilvin'.
