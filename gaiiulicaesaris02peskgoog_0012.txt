PREFACE.

IN preparing this book I have inade constant use 01
the editions 01 Nipperdey (1847), Kraner revised by
F. Hofmann ¹, ed. 9 (1885), Moberley (1888), Dinter (1888),

Paul (1889), E. Hoffmann (1890). But no existing edition
can rank in importance with the great work 01 M. 10 00101101
Stoffel entitled ‘Histoire de Jules Cesar, Guerre Civile‚'

. which continues the late Emperor Napoleon's work on the

Gallie War. This book with its fine atlas has been 01 the
greatest use to me. Another book 01 great value, though in
adifferent way, is the ‘'Lexicon Caesarianum' 01 H. Meusel,
not yet completed‚ probably the rnost elaborate and com-
prehensive dictionary 01 0 single author ever published
M erguet's ‘Lexicon zu den Schriften Casar's und seiner
Fortsetzer‚' compiled on a simplet plan, is also extremely
uselul, and has the merit 01 taking into account the three
treatises usually included in editions ο1 Caesar'. Among
other books that Ι have had occasion to consult I may
mention in particular, General August von Gdler's Der
Biirgerkrieg zwischen 00101 und Pompeius, R. Schneider's
Die Schlacht bei Ilerda H. Nissen’s Der Ausbruch des
Biirgerkriegs, which appeared in Von Sybel’s Historische
Zeitschrift xnrv (1880) and xuvr (1881), Mommsen's

¹ Referred to by me as KH.
² There is another large dictionary to Caesar in course 01 publica·
tion by Menge and Preuss.
