118 DE BELLO CI VILI. [Lm. 1.

proluit] ‘washes down', iu the form of water: cp. Lucan tv. 83

iamque Pyrenaeae quas nunqnam solvere Titan Ι eaaluitstrenere nives, ¹
fractoque madescam Ι sana gelu. The whole of Lucau's rather turgid Ι

description of this storm and flood should be read.

3 utsupra] Caesar had not expressly stated before that his camp Ι

was between two rivers, but a glauce at the map will show that it
was so.

Cingam] the Cinga (now Cinea) joius the Segre on the right about
sor 6 miles from the junction of the latter with the Ebro, or perhaps
it would be more correct to say, following Lucan w. ar foll, that the
Segre joins the Cinea. Between them lies for the most part a level
plain, Lucan tv. 19 explicat hinc tellus campos effusa patentes Ι veie aeneio
prendente modum. To this plain Caesar was now conflated, as ench
river was too swollen for 30 miles of its course to admit of being
crossed. There are said to be traces of a broolr which in such wenther
might easily become a torrent, running through Caesar’s lines, cp. Lucan
1v. 87 e'erm naufraga caerrpa Ι Caesaris arnna natant impulsaque gurgite
muita Ι castra labant ,· to this waterconrse Lucan may refer in the words
mediusvdin‘mit tentoria gurges w. 18, where tentoria may be Cuesar's
teras. ·

4 aenr'eiant] ‘were on their way’.
5 frumenta] the standing crops, to be distinguished from frumarium:
cp. B. G. vr. ²9 curn araturesceresrumenta inciperent, and elsewhere.
hibernis] at first sight this does not seem to suit frumenta (⁸standing
crops’), but the plural senemenla may be conditioned hythe following
clause neque mullum a maturitate aberant. Ι therefore hesitate to
accept herbis the ingenious conjecture of Hellebodiusr cp. M. Cato iu

A. Gellius xl11. 18 nunc ita aieret, in segetibus, in herbis bona stramenta Ι
esse (qu. by Davies): ‘on the one hand, the corn was notin the 1

green blade, so asto be good for forage; and, on the other, it was not
ripe enough to supply food for men'. (Moberley.)

exinanitae] ‘impoverished¹. ’

relique] partitive genitive aster quid, practically the same as si qnid
relictum suerat

7 levis armaturae] a genitive of description after Lusitani ,· cp. ⁸3 Ι 5

Germanas levis armaturae.

cetrati] see note on 39 ᾖ 1.

proclive] properly ‘sloping’, ‘downhill’, hence ‘easy'‚ ‘natural'r in
this derived sense we use the word ‘proclivity'.

quod] this quael, as in 44 5 3, shows how easily aud imperceptibly
