resistance offered at Firmum was slight and easily overcome: (ii) it
Firmo be read, expulso Lentulo need not necessarily mean ‘driven from
F irmum’; why should it not mean ‘driven from the country’ ie. from
Picenum, the district with which the greater part ol the last chapteris
concerned? (iii) ibi need not refer back to Firmo. Surely as Caesar has
last spoken ol lentulus, ibi might very naturally refer to the place
where Lentulus was, ie. Asculum. KH suppose that Caesar wrote
oppido, which occurs in the margin oi one MS, and that the copyist,
remembering the passage in Cicero’s letters, altered it to Firmo. But
such erudition does not accord with what we know of the ways ol
copyists. It is sar more probable that the copyist oi this its kuowing
that Lentulus was at Asculum altered Firmato oppido. The Aldine
edition has Asculo. Cp. Lucan 11. 468 depellitur arce Lmtulus Asculeu.

urged him to go to Luceria where he will be salet than anywhere else:
and in Att. vm. 6 we read that the praetor Sosius brings a copy ol

text, no doubt sent by Domitius on the r5th the date ol Caesar's arrival
