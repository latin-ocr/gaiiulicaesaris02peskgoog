54 DE BELLO CI VILI. [rra 1.

power by the coalition of 60: cp. especially Cicero's letters to Atticus
11. 8, 9, 17, rr 5 1 de re publica queit ego tibi subtiliter? toto periit atque
troc est miserior quom reliquisti, quod tum m'eiebatur eius modi dominatio
deitatem oppressisse quoe iucundo esset multitudini, bonis autem ita
molesta, ut tamen sine peruicie; nune repente tanto iu odeo est omnihus,
ut quorsus eruptura sit horreamus. From the instructive letter Fam.
’ 1. 9 we find how difficult it was lor Cicero to keep on good terms with
both Pompey and Caesar, and how any approach that he might make
to e'ither of them gave offence to the other.
finitatis] generally used ol connexion by marriage. Pompey
married Caesar’s daughter Julia in 59; she died in Sept. 54.
e'reiunxerat] ‘had imposed', generally os laying a burden on a
person; notice that it is here followed bya quasi-personal object quorum
niaximum partem.
5 infamio] the discredit ol, ie: attaching to, caused by, the two
legions.
Asiae Syriaeque] I know of no parallel to this genitive after itinere.
KH qu. 11. 32 5 13 ltaliae fugam, but that is less harsh. Perhaps the
words should be omitted altogether. [The only parallel Ι have seen
quotedis Val. Flaccus 1. 793 placidae sedis iter ,· but iter salutis, gloriae
dre. corne very near 3 so leti vio dre. J. s. rc]
rem ad ormo deduce] ‘that the question should be brought to the
arbitrament os war’. For the phrase cp. 5 5 3 res aei otium deduci,
B. G. v. 31 rem in nomnium periculum deducent, B. C. 1. 19 5 3.

Crrar. V.

1 turbate] this word is of very rare occurrence. ,

extremi iuris] the larthest or last of their rights, to which all the
others lead up, i.e. the most important or fundamental: cf. below 53
illud extremum atque ultimum serratus comultum: but perhaps
extremum is merely a variation sor sumntum=the rigour os their
authority.

intercessione] there is perhaps no need to omit this word: ‘no
opportunity is given the tribunes os retaining, by the exercise os their
veto (intercessione), the most fundamental of their rights (via the right of
exercising the veto) which L. Sulla had left them’. Sulla in 88 and 81
took away'most os the privileges of the tribunes but left them the right
of intercessio, subject however to strict limitations; cp. Liv. Epir„ 89
tribunis plebis potestatem minuit et omne ius legum ferendarum ademit ,·
