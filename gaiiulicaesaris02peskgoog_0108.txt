care. xvn. 111111] NOTES.

eodem die] probably the 16th.
¹ 4 operibus] siege-works.
5 eo triduo] ‘within three days’, ie. on the third day of the siege, 17
Feb. cp. eobr'aluo, 41 5 1. ·
legio VIII] this, as well as the XIIth, had been under the command

of Fabius among the Aedui; see note on 15 §5 Fabius had recently
had 4 legions under his command (Β. G.v111. 54); he would now have
only two after the departure of the x11th and vuttb, but in 57 5 1 heis
said to have 3, hence it is supposed that Trebonius who had 4more
in Belgio Gaul was ordered 10 transfer one of his 10 Fabius, and this
supposition is supported by 36 5 4.

Gallrbc] Gallia Cisalpina, where Caesar had spent the winter. In
addition to these aa cohorts, he had the 7 cohorts which had formed the
garrison of Sulmo, and a few others (perhaps 7) which he had picked up
on his march from the scattered garrisons of Auximum and Asculum,
thus making a total of 36. These 36 cohorts were probably now
organised into three legions, which with the previous three veteran
legions, viz. the vurth, xuth, 11111111, made up an effective force 01 six
legions, to which may be added a body of cavalry. M. Stoffel
reckons his whole force to have consisted 01 11,οοο infantry and 1000
cavalry.

rege Norico] Noricum was the country between the Danube and the
Alps, with chief town Noreia now Neumarkt in carinthia. The Non*-
cans were perhaps grateful 10 Caesar for having relieved them from the
pressure 01 their enemies by his defeat of the Boii and their allius the
Helvetii in 58, B. G. 1. 5. One of Ariovistus’ wives was the sister of
the Noric king Voccio, whether the same king that is mentioned here or
not, is uncertain: B. G. 1. 53.

altera castra] on the S. W. of the town, commanding the via Valeria
and the gorge of Raiano.

p. 11. 6 vara castellisque] ‘vnn a nne or annwons anu redonus:
castella were, as their name implica ‘little camps’ or fortified enclosuree,
placed at intervals along the line of circumvallation and capable. of ac·
commodating small bodies 01 troops. In the siege of Alesia Caesar
constructed 23 castella, and at Dyrrachium Pompey had 24. From
careful researches conducted on the spot M. Stoflel believes that Caesar's
line 01 investment formed a circuit of 5 miles.

circummunire] 1 prefer this 10 the reading of the 1111 circumvenire,
notwithstanding the instances of the latter in Sallust lug. 68, 76. In B. C.
111. 9'7 the weight of us authority is in favour of circummum're.
