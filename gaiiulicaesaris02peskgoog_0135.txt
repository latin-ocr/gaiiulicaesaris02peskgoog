Celtiberiae] the country ol the Celtiberi, corresponding roughly to the
provinces of Guadalajara and Cuenca. Their name signifies that they
were a mixed race of Celts and Iberians: cp. Lucan w. 9 prffugquea
gente adusta Ι Gallorum Celtae miscentes namen Hiberis.

Cantabre's1a powersul tribe on the N. coast, from whom the Bay
