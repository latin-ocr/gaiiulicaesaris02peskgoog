spatie] for the separation of the genitive from its governing noun cp.
111. 9² tautum erat relictum spatii. The genitive dependent on sex dc'es
(instead of spatium sex dierum) is perhaps unexampled.

r omuibus leis.. uppouim‘r] ‘a stand is made against all these persons,
and they are all confronted by speeehes from the consul, Scipio and
Cato '. Beware of taking omuibus lis as a neuter.

a inimicitiae] Cato was an unbending and rather narrata-minded
Roman of the old school, opposed alilre to all political change and to all

giving the title of rex '. Petty foreign princes were sometimes allowed
hythe Roman senate to hold the royal title. For this privilege they
were ready to pay, and the provincial governor would be the person
through whom they would most easily gain the ear of the senate. For
