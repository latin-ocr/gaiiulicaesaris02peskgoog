carr. Lxxrx.-Lxxxr.] NOTES. Ι 145

a peragitatr] this word is not quoted from any other classical autbor;
possibly it is a corruption sor exagitati. ·
montem excelsum] Stoffel says this is Sierra Grosa, which is at the
required distance ol 4 miles from the supposed site ot the last encamp-
ment, and is a conspicuous hill though hardly deserving to be called a
‘losty mountain’
uno fronte contra hostem] ‘on one side only sacing the enemy':
instead of making the usual square entrenchment, they only constructed
one line of earthworks sacing the enemy. ’
neque...dcponunt] ‘without however unloading the packhorses’:
neque bere, as often, is put sor noque tamen.
3 tabernaculo] the Roman tents were made of skins, hence such expres·
sions as sub pellibus hicmare 111. 13 ἓ 5.
horo circiter sexto] it is absurd to suppose, as Stoffel apparently does,
that all the events narrated stom 73 ἓ rto 80 5 3 happened in the first six·
hours os one day, that is, before noon of 29Ju1y. I have no doubt that
the ciusdem dici ol the present passage means 30 July, and that the night
os 29 July was spent by the Afraniaus in the anxious deliberations
implied in Caesar's narrative in 78. Thus the recital of the events of
30 July naturally begins with the words hoc probato consilio ex castris
prrficiscuntur in 78 ἓ 4. Notice too the word cotidie in 78 ξπ, which Ι
take to be a loose and somewhat exaggerated expression sor the 60 0170
hours from the discomfiturc oi the Afraniana on the syth (cp. 71) to the
morning of the goth.
rpem...cquitum] ‘hoping that the pursuit would be delayed by the
departure os our cavalry ’.
4 rcy'cctis legionibus] ‘having tested his legions '.
p· 42. hora decimo] about 4 pm.
cotidianum itineris officim] ‘their usual employment during the
march’3 their ‘usual (or ‘daily') duty' at this time was to harass the
retreating foe.
5 poene terga convertant] ‘arc almost put to night’: the subjectos
convertentis of course the Afraniana

non nulli] ‘several’ (see note on 78 ἓ 1) though denoting a less number
than complures.

Cnnr. LXXXI.

1 notura inz'quo] ‘unlavourable by nature'‚ ‘naturally unsavourable't
natura is an adverbial ablative like more, commodine, iure etc. The
