p. 5. r temporum iniurias inimieorum] ior the double genitive cp.
B. G. 1. ¹9 siueeius aſj‘msiom animi ; 11. 17 earum dierum cmmeetudiue
itineris ,· 111. 18 superiorum dierum Sabini murtetis.

deductum ae depravatum] deducere to lead aside or astray, depravare
to make croaked, distort: tr. ‘had been led astray and his judgement
warped’.

imaa'drb...suae] ‘through jealousy and a desire to depreciate his
(Caesar’sicredit’.

cuius]=eum eius: the erem being concessive, ‘although’ or
‘whereas ’.

a novum1t0inflict armed violence on e tribune would be a most
heinous offence; in fact Cicero says there was an old law that anyone
who struck a tribune was punishable with death. It does not appear
however that on this occasion any actual violence was nsed; cp. Cic.
Fam. xvl- rr Antonius quidem noster et Q. Cassius uuila vi expulsi ad
Caesarem eum Cum'ane profecti erant: even in Appian, B. C. 11. 33,
where great stress is laid on the insult done to the tribunes, the consuls
are represented as only using violent language ς οί drusae Μάρκελλός τε
καὶ Λέντλου ἐκέλευον sair ἀμφὶ τὸν ’Λντώνιον έκστῆναι τοῦ συνεδρίου, μήτι
καί δημαρχοῦντος ὅμως πάθοιεν ἀτοπώτερον ; nor does Antony complain
ol more than ὕβριος cp. Plut. Ant. 5 Λέντλος ὑπατεύων ἐξέβαλε τῆς βουλῆς

Cic. Phil. 11. 51 ioll.; Suet. Caes. 31·

iu re publica] “as osten, an attributive phrase to exemplum, hence
notin rem prebluam ’'. J. s, R.

notaretur] Madvig cj. vetaretur, bnt this use oi vela is not elsewhere
found in Caesar, and seems to be confined to poetry and later prose, cp.
Tac. Hist. 1. aa mathematici gersus hominm quadiu civitate mostra et
vetabitur semper et retinebitur. The slight harshness oi notaretur is
sosteued hythe proximityolopprimeretur on which the chiei stress of the
sentence lies.

restituta] by Pompey in his first consulship uc. 70. The word
armis which occurs in the uss, after aunis 1 omit as an obvious slip os
the copyist.

3 Sullam] see note on 5 ξ 1: the statement in the text is not strictly
correct, as Sulla did not leave the tribunes the right oi veto unimpaired.
