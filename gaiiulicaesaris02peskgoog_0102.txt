1 progressus] probably on 4 Feb.

omnem...pmum‘t] this evidently implies more than a march straight
through Picenum from Auximum to Asculum, and is sofar an argument

praefecturae] one ol the three classes of Italian towns, the others
being coloniae and municipia: they were so called because their

progressus.

cupidissime] ‘with the utmost devotion’: cupidus, cupiditas are
