arrival of his successor on 1 Jan. 48 3 for otherwise what would
be the force of the permission to offer himself as a candidate in
his absence? Subsequently there was passed the lex Pompeia
de iure magistratuum, which enacted (i) that consuls and praetors
should not hold provincial appointments till the expirationos five
years from their term of office ; this would allow of a successor
to Caesar being appointed on 1 March, 49¹: (ii) that in accor-
dance with the old rule no one should be allowed to stand for an
office in his absencet. lt will be observed that this second law
was in direct antagonism to the privilege granted to Caesar by
the plebiscitum. Pompey’s attention was called to the dis· -
’ crepancy, and he thereupon added a clause to his law excepting
Caesar from its operation. It is almost incredible that he should
thus have recklessly flung away the strong position that his own
‘measure secured him. However it was afterwards argued by
the lawyers that the clause had been illegally added and was
therefore worthless. In the following year, 51, Caesar sent a,
request to the senate that his govemorship should be prolonged
till the end of 49. The request was not entertained at the time,
but Caesar’s partisans refused to let the matter drop, and it was
frequently discussed during the course of the year. On 29
September a proposal was made that the appointment should
terminate on 1 March, 493 but this was rejected by a large
majority. Finally it was agreed after some discussion that the
question of appointing a successor to Caesar should be deferred
till 1 March, 50. When the day came the matter was again
postponed. The next proposal was that eaesars tenure of the
province should be prolonged to 13 November, 49, but again a
settlement of the difficulty was prevented by the opposition of
Curio, who had now become a partisan of Caesar. After ‘many
other abortive attempts at a compromise it was finally proposed,
first that Caesar should give up his province and disband¹ his
army, secondly that both generals should disarm simultaneously.
A large majority voted in favour of the first proposal ; the second

chapters of the same law.
