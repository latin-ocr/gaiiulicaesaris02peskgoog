cars. cxxvi-nxxrx] NOTES. Ῑ43

Ilerda to Octogesa would make his men carry provisioni for more

t Α than ro or rr days at the outside.

a facultates] ‘means’‚ ‘opportunities’3 the word is of constant use
in Caesar and does not by anymeans necessarily imply ‘pecnniary
resources’ as Moberley translates it.

insueta aa'] the construction is found in Livy, but Caesar elsewhere
has the genitive aster insuetus. The auxiliaries did not undergo the
severe training of the Roman legionarias and lacked their extraordinary
powers of endnranee.

3 explicitius] ‘the simpler', ‘the least complicated’‚ from explicare ‘to
unravel’, a word frequently found with cnuilium as below se reliquum
eonsilium explicaturos, 111. 78 5 3 eta, and cp.111. 755 a bis optentu
rebus.

se reliwune consilium explicaturos] a literal rendering of thiais
impossible; we might represent the meaning fairly by translating
‘that they would evolve at leisure (or ‘in detail’) the rest of their
plans’. Moberley’s translation ‘to form plans for the future’ is
inadequate.

4 Tarraca] a distance of about 4ο or 50 miles.

recepere] reru is the subject, casus tlre object, of recepere: ‘their
adventure (‘ fortune ’‚ ‘undertaldng’) might meet with variousaocidents’,
or ‘various accidents might befall their adventure's cp. 111. 5135 quae
res tamen sortasse aliquem recuperet casura

prolieisnentur] probably in the early morning of r9 Julyr see note on
8053. .

p. 41. 5 carperet] cp. 6352, B. Afr. 7554.

nullum...proeliorentnr] ‘not a moment passed without the rear·

guard fighting with the cavalry ’.

Cass. LXXIX.

r pluresque] ‘and several of them’, that is of the light-armed cohorts.
subsistebant] ‘halted’, ‘lingered behind', in order to protect the
main body from the attacks of the cavalry. The sense would no
doubt be rendered easier by reading equitesque for pluresque and
sustinebant for subsistebant ‘kept the cavalry in checlr’.
3 cum] ‘whenever' ; with nem in this sense the pluperiect indicative is
more common than the imperfect, Roby 5 17¹7·
suberat] ‘lay before them'.
neque ei...poterant]=es' ei...non poterant.
