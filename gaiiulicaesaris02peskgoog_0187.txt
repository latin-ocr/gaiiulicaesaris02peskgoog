158 nn narro cerere.

28 a quinquaginta ordiner Mss; the editors generally read quinque
ordinis senatorii after Davis and Nipperdey, but E. Hoffmann
retains quinquaginta, reading eram quinquaginta; oreimis unatoeii
etc.

L. Caecilius Spinther Rufies MSS, an evident confusion, the name
Spinther belonging properly to Lentulus. We may read either
L. Caecilius Rufius, for whom see note, or L. Vibullius Rufius who
has been mentioned before.

gloquitur quod uss: the insertion of queritur aller loquitur had
occurred to myself before I saw that it had been suggested by
Halbertsma and is actually adopted by Paul, who however alters
loquitur to laertius. But Ι leave the text as it stands, not being
confident that it is wrong.

4ab iis (or ltu) viris MSS, apparently corruptions of llvin‘s. Momm-
sen proposes I Vestris, but the provincial quattuor-uiri seem to have
consisted of two bodies ol tamiri one of which may have had higher
powers than the other.

5 eo eiie nss; Meusel‚ Dinter and Paul needlessly read eodem die.

2⁵ 3 inveniri Mss; Paul needlessly suggests invenire.

extremis Mss3 most editors ab extremis, some preposition being
needed: Dr Reid suggests ex manumet.

6 pedum XXX all Mss except l which bas LXXX.
9 incursus uss ς Paul thinking the word unsuitable reads ingressus.

20 1 turres eune ternis tubrelatis Mss; Paul argues that the preposition
cannot be thus used and so reads quaternis, which if written I V ternis
might easily become cum tumn. Ι retain the traditional reading
though admitting that no exact parallel to it has been produced.

opera disturbaret uss: Paul suggests the omission of opera.

17 3 oppidum irrumperent Mss; see note'.

4e'naequat uss3 the word is not found elsewhere and Dr Reid
⁵ suggests iuncta aequat.
5sagittaeiei uss; better sense would be obtained by reading nem
sagittariis conjectured by Koechly and Reid. Meusel prefers sagitta·
rios fiende'torerque, assuming the words to have been changed to the
ablative by the proximity of ex evuatin

20 gueterem exercitum nss; there is no need for Elberling’s vetere

exern'tu adopted by Paul. Caesar did not like the idea of Pompey’s

veteran anny in Spain being confirmed by the presence of its leader
without any interference on his own part.

eor legionibus III Mss; Davies altered the number to IV, corfrparing
