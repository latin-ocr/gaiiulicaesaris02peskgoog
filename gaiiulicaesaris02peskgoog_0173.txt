144 DE BELLO CI VILI. [mn. 1.

maenalus] ii, as seems probable‚ the army was following a defined

uaek across difficult country, the line would extend to some distem,
and the rearguard might naturally be called maram as compared with
the vanguard. Hence there is no need to alter this to laborantibus.

equites vero] ‘while the cavalry'; this clause, as well as the two
preceding, depends on cum: the word vera, like dessiqae, added to
the last ol a succession οἰ clauses, denotas the climax

in aversas] ‘against them when their backs were turned ’.

4 relinquebatur, ut] ‘the only coume leit was that’ etc.; cp. 29 fla,

63 fl a.

erana...esset] the subjunctive is used ‘of actions, events, etc. recounted
not as mere marks oi time, but as essential parts ol the historical

narrative, in imperfect and pluperiect teuses’ Roby ἕ ¹7²⁰· The 2

mood might perhaps be explained by the fact that this clause is
inserted in another subjunctive clause us...e·aberens, and is therefore
what Dr Kennedy called a ‘suboblique’ clause, Kenn. L.G.§§19o-193.
a'acitate'⁸ curas] cp. 111. 46 ἓ 5 incitati cursu praecipites Pompeianas
gaam, 93 ἓ 5 incitati suga,⁸ we also find incitatamrsu B. G. 11. 26.

5 tantum,..alerant] ‘they were so iar from being aided by their
cavalry'3 ·notice that lantum abesse ab is here not used os actual
distance: KH cp. B. G. 1. 36 laeage eis fraternam nomen populi
Romani aflaturum.

altro] the nearest English equivalent to this very expressive word is
‘actually’s not only did the cavalry not protect the legions, but the
legions had actually to protect the cavalry.

quin] the use of quin rather than ne shows that licebat is used oi
possibility rather than oi permusa'esn: ‘itwas not possible ior any one
oi them to quit the line of march without being caught by Caesar's
horsemen’: is Caesar had meant ‘no one of them was allowed to quit’
eto, he would have added ne...exca'peretur ‘leet he should be caught’.

Cass. LXXX.

r puagnatur] this is a perlectly general statement: ‘when a battle is
being fought in this way, troops advance slowly’ etc. 1t is shown that
the general statement applies to this particular occasion.

ut tum acalla't] ‘and so it happened on this occasion ’z cp. Β. G. vn.
3 nam ubicumque maiar atque illustrior incedit res, clamore per agras
regiamque agagiten& lunc alli deinceps exceptans et pmximis tradunt,
ut tum accidit.
