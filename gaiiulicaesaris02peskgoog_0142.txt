carr. xerxe—xcv] NOTES.

Cure. XLIV.

r ut] the clause with ut is explanatory of the noun in the main clause
(genuslr cp. 11. 18 5 6 ratic autem haec crat belli ut sc...canferret (qu. by
KH); Cic. Verr. 11. 129 est consuetudo Sicularum...ut nonnunquam...
eximant: Draeger HS. 11. 5 405.

rari dispersique] ‘singly and in scattered order '.
p. 25. ι amsans] wie araeve ‘habituated in’3cp.B.G.1v.1nuac
officia aut disciplina assuefacti, 3 Gallicis sunt maribus assuefacti.
3 quad] probably the relative, not ‘because 'z ‘a thing which usually
happens’; this is further explained by the ut clause which follows.
4 innectas liuius generis pugnae] for the genitive with innatus cp. 111.
49 5 33 B. G. v. 6, vrt- 30: it can also take an ablative as in Livy
xxvm. 18 insuetus mumius Romanis. N otice that pugnae may be the
’ genitive aiter generis or vice versa3 you can say luc genus pugnae or
pugna leuius generis without any appreciable difference in the meaning;
er· 39 t 2·

ab aperta¹ latere] ‘on their exposed flank', i.e. on their leste they
. were afraid of the XIVth legion being outflankedr sometimes the
. preposition is omitted in this phrase, in which case it is a local ablative,
cp.B.G.1.25,11.a3.

apsi...opcrterc] the text is probably faulty. KH say ‘oportet can taire
a simple infinitive when the subject is indefinite, but requires an
aecusative and infinitive when the subject is definite: with discedere
³ and sanare the subject is indefinite, “one must” etc.; with dimitti the
implied subject is definite' i.e. ‘they did not think it right that they
should relinquish' etc. This explanation may be adopted as a
temporary expedient.

5 in ec cornu] the left wing which was occupied by the XIVth.

’ proximum collem] apparently some rising ground at the back oi their
position and westward oi Puig Bordel. Stoffel calls it Las Collades.

Cnxr. XLV.

l a dum...aalunt] dum with the present indicative is here equivalent to a
present participle; ‘wishing to heal’, ‘in their wish to heal '.

sarcire] so in111. 67 5 a cespiass eius aiei detrimentum sarcire, 73 5 5
ut acceptum incommodum virtute sarciretur, 74 5 a studium insucatae
sarciena'cte.
