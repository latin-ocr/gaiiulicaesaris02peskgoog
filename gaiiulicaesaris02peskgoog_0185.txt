0 a aut sequautur saltem: l has statim, f statim saltim ; hence E. Hoff-
mann reads sequantur, statim de reliquis etc.

3 habeatur uss ; there is no need to alter this to habeantur, though in
5 8 Caesar bas tota ltalia tilectus habentur.

4nan pmsurum MSS, but 0² has vera which most editors adopt.
Madvig and Meusel prefer camd. After passumm h bas se,· as
Caesar does not elsewhere omit the reflexive pronoun after negare, l
retain it here.

Ἰ a The uss have amis after annis, probably a mere slip. Hotoman
ej. sine armis.

4dona uss bana Victorius. Dr Reid says ‘perhaps tribunis is the
right reading, tri having been lost by collision with tur and contrac-
tion, and the remainder having been rnisread or corrected to make
sense: a subject to habuerint is wanted ’.

5 After ne cogitatum quuim the uss have nulla lex promulgata, nan
curn popula agi caeptum, nulla secernit facta,· the clause is an obvious
gloss, being quite out of construction with the context, and is rightly
omitted by the editors.

7 convenerant h lf ς venrant abd.

8 4 rebus uss, Clark cj. verbis adopted by all recent editors, cp. a 9 4.
Oraba have P. R. after primam, d apparently inserts them before
primam, in hlf they are absent, probably absorbed by the first
letters ofprimam. Paul omits them. Most editors bave reipublicae
which is more likely to be right here than papuli Romani.
to rhlfhave mm Caesare, a b c d a Caesam I retain the former with
the addition of the praenomen which Caesar is not likely to have
omitted. So E. Hoffmann.
invenit MSS, Paul suggests convenit which, though possible, is not
necessary.

adeliberata MSS, Gruter first added re, which would easily drop out

before respondent.
rundata renu'ttunt: this is the ordinary reading, but the uss have
permittunt, aud Paul following Hotoman reads mndata per easdem
remittunt: KH par eos mittunt.
n a quem diem ruse, Paul quam as more in accordante with Caerar's
usage, dier when meaning a date being usually feminine.
peracto consulatu uss, Paul ej. parta, E. Hoffmann pacto: Dr
Reid suggests that the words may be loosely used for peractis comitiis
quibus Caesar conat sactus esset ‘after Caesar’s election to the
consulate had been carried through ’. In place of nan after Caesarne,
