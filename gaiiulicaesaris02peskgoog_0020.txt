§ra Coalitr'on os Pompey and Caesar.

ln 62 Caesar held the office of praetor. ln 61 Pompey, who
had now returned to Rome, celebrated his third triumph, while
Caesar was absent as governor ol Hispania Ulterior. On his
return from Spain the following year he found a growing state
of tension between Pompey and the optimates, that is, the well-
to-do classes, who having a stake in the country were desirous
of maintaining the republican constitution, and were alike
opposed on the one hand to the excesses of an unbridled
democracy and on the other to the threatened despotism of a
military leader. Pompey's arrogant pretensions were beginning
to estrange men of this character, and it seems to have occurred
both to him and to Caesar that by forming a coalition they
would strengthen their respective positions. Each hoped to use
the resources of the other for his own purposes. Crassus, whose
great wealth and importance in the commercial world rather
than any singular ability made him a power in the state, was
necessary to the stability of the coalition, and was accordingly
admitted to the partnership. Thus was formed the so·called
first triumvirate. The political alliance was cemented by the
marriage of Pompey to Caesar's daughter Julia Each member
of the alliance gained his immediate objects. Caesar attained
the consulship for 59 and won great popularity by carrying some
agrarian relorms in spite of the opposition of the optimates ;
Crassus and the men of business were gratified by the remission
of an unfavourable contract into which the tax-sarmers had
entered and from which they had long sought release3 Pompey
gained from the senate the long-delayed ratification of his
political measures in Asia. .

ἕ 13. Caesar in Gaul.

It was now arranged that Caesar should have the governor-
ship of Gallia Cisalpina, Gallia Narbonensis and Illyricum for five
= years. By this means he would be able, as he no doubt foresaw,
to train, in a series of campaigns against the wild tribes of Gaul.
