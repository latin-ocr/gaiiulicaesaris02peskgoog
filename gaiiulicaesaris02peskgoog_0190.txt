APPENDIX. 161

urcliquit as, relinquit hl: there is nothing objectionable in the se·
quence reliquit, prefin'seitur, constitit, facit. Paul reads relinquit
and consistit to secure uniformity.
4 pust lece MSS, by careless assimilation to opus.
ᾗ 43 1 in oppido Ilerda et proximo colle MSS3 inter having been corrupted
to in, the rest followed as a matter of course.
planicia a (Ρ) h l; most editors aster other MSS plnuuics. 1
agree with Meusel who says milei ‘planicies’ nullo mode ferri posse
uidetur, but 1 cannot accept his planitia.
3 in locis idoneis MSS; Paul omits in as contrary to Caesar’s usage.
44 areliquisqne barbaris genere quodam Mss; 1 read with Diibner and
Mense] reliquisque barbaris barbaro genere quodum Dinter and KH
ι reliquisque barbaro. Nipperdey and Ε. Hoffmann retain the reading
of the MSS: for the text cp. 111. 9 5 1 Dalmatis reliquisque barbaris. -
3 quibus quisque MSS, quibuscunque Paul.
4ccnsuerunt metere MSS3 as operum canum easily be constructed
with seruare and discedere, Paul inserts emeruerant after ds'seeclere,
thinking that its similarity to censsuraut may have caused it to drop
out. Nipperdey and E. Hoffmann alter rennuerunt to canuerant,
making an almost impossible construction. 1 retain the reading of
the MSS, adopting doubtfully the explanation given by KH : ,see note.
Iwould suggest as a possible emendation the insertion ol se before
seruare and the change of dimitti into dimittere.
46 4 directus MSS, but derectm is elsewhere the better attested form.
5 passuum Mss; Meusel and Paul passus which is likely so be right.
7 angebantur illis copiae Ohl, the rest augebatur illis copia which can
hardly be desended3 cp. B. C. 11. 41 5 7 hostium ccps'ae...nugebantnr.
4ο 3sunsmum iugum MSS, except Ο bwhich have summum in iugum:
summa in iugum Forchhammer‚ and most recent editors. Nipperdey
in sunemum tergum.
47 a initio MSS; there seems no need lor Paul's ab initu. ι
48 4eomitntns Mss; the same corruption in 51 5 13 see too 54 5 5
Eanum
5in lu'bernis MSS3 Hellebodius on the ground that this did not suit
the plural frumenta (standing crops) altered deberitis to herbis, but
the plural seems to be conditioned by the following clause, neque
mullum a maturitate aberam. lsheretore with some hesitation
retain the reading ol the Mss. Paul reads nutu, KH aenan,-
other suggestions are horreis, cauernis, tabernis etc.
41 1 comitatus MSS; cp. 48 5 4.
