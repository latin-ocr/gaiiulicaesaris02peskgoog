xvi INTRODUCTION.

an army devoted to his interests and strong enough to cope in
case of need with the veteran legions of Pompey. He started
for his province in March 58, and at once began the long career
of conquest, the details of which are familiar to all readers of
the ‘Bellum Gallicum! It may suffice here to say that each
winter, when hostilities naturally ceased, he joumeyed to the
borders of Italy to keep himself in touch 'with the political
movements of the capital and to confer with his adherente In
the spring of 56 he had a conference with Pompey and Crassus
at Luca, and the politica] arrangements of the next few years

It may be useful here to consider briefly the general state of
feeling at Rome at this time. For this our best gulde is the
correspondence of Cicero with Atticus and others. Cicero may

rate optimates, who though nominally partisans of Pompey yet
felt almost as much distrust of their leader as they did of his
rival, Caesar, the champion of the democratic or popular party.

Above all things they desired peace, and to secure it they were ·

willing on occasion to sacrifice a little of their principles
From these we may distinguish those whom Nissen calls the
