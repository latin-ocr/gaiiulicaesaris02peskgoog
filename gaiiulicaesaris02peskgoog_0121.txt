prium Brundisrb ad. XVI K. Apriles (ry March) cum omnibus copiis
quas babuit profectum esse ,· Caesarem postera die irs appellum introisse.
Rumours of Pompey's departure at an earlier date had reached Cicero,

’ Att.1x.13§r,14§3. ·

3 sub] ‘just at the moment oi’; cp. B. G. νιιι. 49 sub decosu sue.
“This temporal use ol sub with ablative not before Caesar, though
Cicero has the corresponding local use (Att. xw. 7 5 ι sub Lanuvio
‘close to') which Draeger says is only poetical.'' J. s. ιι.

oppidum] the ntss omit iu as in 11. ¹3 ἕ 4 quin oppidum irrum-
perent where however in might easily have fallen out aiter quire. Paul
inserts the preposition, but leaves ιιι. ιιι 5 1 prima impetu domum eius
irrumpere ematur, though Cic. de orat. ιιι. ι68 has in demum irmin-
pere: as a mle the simple accusative is poetical and in late prose.

auos plateasque] ‘streets and squares'z oteres (οἶκοι) is properly a
group or row oi houses, then the street formed by them; platea (πλατεῖα)
is a broad open space.

inaedificat] ‘builds up’‚ i.e. ‘blocks'; ep. Livy xuv, 45 nee
clausae mado partae sed etiam inaedficatae erant,· Cic. Har. Resp. 32

probably gevemed by praeducit, ‘draws trenches at right angles in iront
of the streets'5 cp. Silius Ital. x. 410 fassas instant praeducere murts.
For transversus ‘across’, ‘at right angles’ cp. B. G. ιι. 8 traammam
fossam abduxit. Dr Reid suggests transversis aiis like aamverso
itinere, flumine etc.

ibe]=ineis‚cp. 2651.

sudes stipitesque] ‘stakes and blocks of wood'.

4 laec...inaequat] ‘he levels these (with the rest oi the road) by
covering them with light hurdles and eartb'. The word inaequalis
ἅπαξ εἰρημένοις elsewhere Caesar has aequare or adaequare, and
Dr Reid thinks that tbe in here may be a temnant ol some word such
as inr'ecta.

aditus] ‘approaches'3 the duo belongs only to itinera: cp. Β. G.

v1. 9 aditus arasque in Suebos perquirat. By duo itinera are probably
meant the narrow strips ol shore between the walls of the town and the
two arms ol the sea.

trabibus] ‘balks oi timber’: these were fixed deeply in (defixis) with
their sharpened ends projeeting.
5 silentia] an adverbial ablative very frequent in Caesar, twice with
