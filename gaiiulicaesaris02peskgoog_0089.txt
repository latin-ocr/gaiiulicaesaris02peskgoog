more limited in extent than that of the consul or praetor, but was

paludatique] wearing the paludamentum or scarlet cloalr appropriated
to generals holding the impen'um.

votis nuncupata] ‘alter oflering vows’. Festus explains ‘vata
nuncupata dicuutur quae cumules praetores mm in prmimtbm pnpi-
ciscuntur faciunt ; ea in tabidas praesentibus miultis referuntur‘: cp.
Livy, xxi. 63 C. Flaminium fugibse ne...auspicalo prtffe'ctus in
Capitolium ad vota nuncupanda paludatus inde cum lictoribus in
provinciam iret.

quod ante id ternpus accidit uunquam] this statement is so demon·
strably and even ludicrously nntrue that Voss, Nipperdey and others
would eject the words altogether. But Caesar who elsewhere in this
narrative shows a disregard lor truth no doubt relied on his readers
having short memories‚ and I do not see why he should be less likely
to make a salse statement, itit suited his purpose todo so, than a
modern Christian statesman. Before the time ot Sulla it had been the
regular thing for the consuls to leave the city during their term of office,
and although in 81 the lex Cornelia de provinciis enacted that they
should not leave it till the expiration of their year, yet between that
date and 49 there had been five or six instances ol the rnle being
contravened. Caesar however for his own purposes chooses to ignore
these. Tm subject is lully discussed by Mommsen, Rechtssrage, p. ²9
foll, and by Nipperdey, Quaestiones, 128 foll, and in an article in the
Rheinisches Museum, xvu. 1862 reprinted in his Opuscula‚ p. μα loll.
[lt was the going in and out of the city and yet retaining tbe imperium
which Caesar declared unparalleled. He would never have said that
breaking a usage which had only existed since Sulla was contra ontin'a
vetustatis exempla. By this recrossing of the pomerium alter leaving it
in military array they became pm'vati. J. s. tu]

7 privata] Ι take this word to reter to the consuls and praetors just
mentioned who were on the point oi leaving the city attended by their
lictors and with all the insignia os authority. Caesar invidiously mlls
them privati because they had not had the imperium properly conferred
on them. KH and Doberenz think that the prmonmles ad urbem 5 5 3
are meant.

vetustatis] ‘former times’, ‘the past ’.’
