INTROI) UCTION. xiii

ἓ 9. Gneus Pompeius and tlte reversal of tle Sullan policy.

M. Lepidus headed the revival of the popular party in Rome,
and in Spain Q. Sertorius as the leader of the emigrant
democrats stirred up a rebellion which was not subdued for
three years. The general who was finally successful in crushing
the revolt was Gneus Pompeius, who had been for some time
known as a brave and skilful officer and now became the leading
man in the state. He received the proconsular command in
Spain before he had reached the age of 30, and therefore before
he had held the ordinary state offices. He had never been a
hearty adherent of Sulla, and now on his retum from Spain
being desirous of the honour of a triumph, to which he was not
legally entitled‚ he definitely broke with the Sullan party and
espoused the cause of the opposition. By their aid he gained the
consulship and a triumph. Thus were the Sullan regulations
respecting the tenure of the different magistracies summarily set

Pompey's colleague in the consulship was M. Crassus, the
great capitalist, who had recently quelled the rising of the slaves
under Spartacus, and who, like Pompey, saw his best chance of
political power in espousing the cause xof democracy. Under
these two leaders the opposition succeeded in reversing much
of the policy of Sulla. The tribunes were reinstated in their
ancient prerogatives, and for the corrupt senatorial jury courts
were substituted mixed courts of senators, equites and tribuni
aerarii. But though the rule of the senate was weakened, and
the popular cause again in the ascendant, the old republic was
practically dead, and the substance of power lay in the hands of
the strongest military leader. That position was now held by
Pompey. But Pompey was not fitted by nature or inclination
to be a democratic leader, and we accordingly find him becoming
in time a closer ally of the moderate senatorial party, who
looked to him as the champion of order. He was entmsted
with extraordinary powers to prosecute the war against the
pirates who were infesting the shores of the Mediterranean, and
against Mithradates, the great Eastern king, whose armies
