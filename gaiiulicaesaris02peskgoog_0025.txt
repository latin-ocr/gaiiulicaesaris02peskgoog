proposal was then put in an altered form, that Pompey should
disarm; this was rejected by a large majority. lt was then again
put in its original form, that both generals should disarm simul·
taneously‚ and was thereupon carried by the large majority of 370 ’
to 221. The execution of this decree was hindered hythe Pom-
peians, who thereby put themselves in the wrong by resisting
the expressed will of the senate. Meanwhile in view of Caesars
threatening altitude on the frontier and the impossibility of a
satisfactory settlement of the points at issue, it was felt to be
necessary that immediate steps should be taken for the defence
of the capital. The task was naturally assigned to Pompey, who
began to raise levies and organise the forces of the common·
wealth. Curio feeling that war was inevitable fied to Caesar.
But Caesar had apparently not yet abandoned all hope of com-
promise, or perhaps it would be more correct to say that he
determined to put the Pompeians as clearly as possible in the
wrong. He sent an ultimatum by the hands of Curio, offering
to disband his troops if Pompey would do the same. This
was brought before the senate on 1 Jan 49. At this point
the history of the Civil War opens. How the last attempt at
negotiation failed and the long impending war broke out may be
read in Caesars own narrative.
