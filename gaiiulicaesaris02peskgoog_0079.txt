50 DE Bruto cJVJrJ. [nar.

paucis sere] ‘only a few’: Cicero would have written moda

5 correpti] ‘caught up’: tr. ‘all these were caught up and assailed
with vehement invective by the consul L. Lentulus ’‚ cp. Hor. Sat. 11.
3. ο 57 correptio voce magistri. The consul’s violent language is attested
bylPlutarch Caes. 30, Λέπλου τοῦ trtrov βοῶντος ὅπλων δεῖν πρὸς ἄνδρα
ληοτὴν οὐ ψήφων, though he assigna it to a different part of the day’s
proceedings: his account is altogether confusing, cp. Pomp. 58 Μαο
κέλλοο τοῦ ὑπάτου ληπτὴν ἀποκαλοῦντος τὸν Καίσαρα.

pronuntiaturum] the presiding magistrate is said pronuntrbre ‘to
put’ a motion to the senate to be voted on.

Marcellus] the M. Marcellus of§ ο.

conviciis] cp. 23 5 3 aesomnes productos a contumeliis militum con·
va‘cr‘rlque proht'bet ; above ἓ 5 convicio L. munli. The plural is more
appropriate where the abuse proceeds from various quarters; so here the
reference is to the Pompeian senators generally.

6 umidius] ‘expressions ’, ‘language ’‚ see below ὅθ 5 quorum vocibus er
concursu. The plural is always used of a startling or otherwise re·
markableutterance.

inviti et crach] these words are not coordinate with compulsi, but
form a kind of abverbial adjunct to it ε ‘a large number impelled (com-
pulsi) by...against their will and yielding to pressure adopt the opinion
of Scipio ’. According to Dion xm. a only two, Curio and Rufus,
voted against Scipio’s proposal. [Plut. Ant. 5 says that many senators
were influenced by the terms of Caesar's letter which they thought just
and moderate δίκαια rol μέτρια. J. s.'1t.]

ante certam diens] from the expression erepto semestri imperio in 9
ξ awe may assume with Lange R. A. 111. 406 and Mommsen Rechts·

· frage p. 58 that the date in question was July rst‚ which would just
allow of Caesar’s offering himself in person as a candidate for the con·
sulship the requisite time (trinum nundinum) before the election.
Others take the date to be March rst. ’

8 intercedit] M. Antonius is chiefly in the writer's thought, hence he
begins the sentence with the singular intercedit though two nouus
follow and the plural tribuni in apposition to them: a similar sentence
is ‘and so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee’. Luke
v. ιο.

refertur] Scipio’s proposed, though carried by an overwhelming
majority, could not be embodied in a sotatur conmttum on account of
the veto of the tribunes: their intervention provoked a fresh debate.
The resolution was however placed on record as an auctoritas ὴγνώμη
