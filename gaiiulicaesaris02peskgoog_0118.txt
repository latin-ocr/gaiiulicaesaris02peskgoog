under whose superintendence the place has been thoroughly examined,
states that each pier was about 75 yards long. This would leave a
channel oi roo yards which would be further lessened by the rafts.

contineri] ‘held together¹: the water being deep the dam broke up
as fast as it was made. Dr Reid thinks contineri wrong and suggests
continuari ,· because of the depth of the water Caesar could not carry ,
the mole across in au unhroken line, cp. continuare pontem Tac. Anu

rates duplices] it is not clear whether this means two rafts, each
30 ft. by 15 ft, placed side by side so as to form as it were' asingle raft
oi 30 ft. square, or whether we mustsuppose that for the sake of
additional carrying power one raft was placed on the top of another,
each of the two being 30 feet square. On the whole 1 prefer the latter ,
view supported by G'o'ler and Stoffelr Dr Reid however suggests that ·
Ι the word duplices may mean that the rafts were made in pairs aud oue ¹
of each pair anchored at each of the two incomplete aggeres. Some
objection has been raised by Gdler aud others to the number XXX, on
the ground that rafts 30 ft. square would not be large enough for the
various erections placed on them, but l do not think that any alteration
is needed.
eregione molis] ‘over against the end of the breakwater', forming as
it were a continuatiou of the breakwater.

8 iungebat] ‘attached’ to the end of the former. It was Caesar's
t intention to unite the two ends of the piers by a chain of rafts and so
bar the channel, but the work was never completed, cp. 27 ἕ 1 prope
dinridia parte operis effecta ,· how many ratis were placed in position we
cannot now say. but probably more than ‘three or four‘ which is Col.
Stoffel’s estimem, for Caesar says that he proceeded to erect tovers ‘ on
every fourth raft'. This argument however will not hold if the im·
perfect excitabat denotes merely the unfulfilled intention. lt would
require ro rafts to fill up the whole space between the piers supposing it
to have been roo yards.
9 terra atque aggere] ‘soil and a raised causeway’.
ne aditus...impediretur] ‘that ,there might be no obstacle in the
way of approach or ingress for the purpose of defence '.
afrente] the front or end of the raft facing mid-chanue13 as each raft
was completed these defences a fronte would, I suppose, be removed
and transferred to the srout or end of the next raft and so ou.
