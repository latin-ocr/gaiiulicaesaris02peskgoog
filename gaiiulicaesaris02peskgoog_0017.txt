xii INTRODUCTION.

war taxed all the energies o fthe state. A memorable incident of
this war was the attempt of the ltalians to establish the town of
Corfinium m Umbria as a rival capital to Rome. Though the
insurgents were defeated, a partial admission to the franchise
rewarded their heroism but did not appease their discontent.

57. P. Sulpicius Rufus.

An attempt to satisiy their claims lor a more satisfactory
incorporation in the Roman burgess body was now made by
Marius and byP. Sulpicius Rufus, tribune m 88. To prevent
their proposals from being put to the vote the consuls pro·
claimed a suspension of public business. Sulpicius and his
armed gangs drove the consuls from the somm, and the laws
were carried. One oi the new enactments was that the conduct
ol the war with Mithradates which had recently begun should
be entrusted to the now aged Marius.

§8 l. Cornelius Sulla.

But the consul, L. Cornelius Sulla, was not the man to be
thus summarily set aside. Bold, ambitious, a skiliul soldier
and an astute politician, he now determined on a decisive
stroke. Summoning his legions he advanced on the capital,
and aster a brief struggle entered, Rome in triumph. “Thus,”
as Mommsen says, “the first military intervention in civil feuds
had sully demonstrated, not only that the political struggles had
reached the point at which nothing save open and direct force
proves decisive, but also that the power oi the bludgeon was ol
no avail against the power ol the sword.” The Sulpician laws
were at once set aside, and the supremacy of Sulla was es-
tablished. He made it his chief aim to crush the rising
democracy by ruthl'ess proscriptions, by increasing the power
os the senate, by bringing the magistrates more under senatorial
control, by abridging the competence of the tribunes, and by
putting the military forces ol the republic into the position of a
professional standing army. A supremacy based on such violent
and reactionary methods was not likely to be enduring, and in
a few years the Sullan constitution was overthrown.
